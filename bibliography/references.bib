  abstract = {Objectives: We aimed to assess the abilities of short-time low positive end-expiratory pressure challenge (SLPC) and mini-fluid challenge (MFC) to predict fluid responsiveness with the uncalibrated arterial waveform analysis device in the operating room. Methods: Stroke volume index (SVI), pulse pressure variation (PPV), and stroke volume variation (SVV) were recorded before SLPC (T1) at the end of the 30 s of SLPC (T2), 3 min after SLPC (T3), 1 min after MFC with the infusion of 100 mL of crystalloid (T4), and 3 min after fluid loading was completed with additional 400 mL of crystalloid (T5). Patients whose SVI increased more than 15\% after the fluid loading were defined as responders. Along with PPV and SVV, percentage changes in SVI due to SLPC and MFC were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROCAUC) for predicting fluid responsiveness. Results: Thirty patients completed the study. Fourteen (47\%) of them were responders. ROCAUC values of SLPC, MFC, PPV, and SVV were 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.76\textendash 0.99), 0.94 (95\% CI: 0.79\textendash 0.99), 0,68 (95\% CI: 0.49\textendash 0.84), and 0.51 (95\% CI: 0.32\textendash 0.70), respectively. ROCAUC values of SLPC and MFC were comparable (p= 0.73), and they were both statistical significantly higher than those of SVV and PPV. The best cutoff values of SVI percentage change to predict fluid responsiveness were 5.1\% and 6.7\% for SLPC and MFC, respectively. Conclusion: SVI percentage change during SLPC and after MFC can predict fluid responsiveness better than PPV and SVV in the operating room.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) can predict fluid responsiveness effectively. However, high Body Mass Index (BMI) can restrict their use due to changes in respiratory system compliance (CS), intra-abdominal pressure, and stroke volume (SV) in the prone position. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mini-fluid challenge (MFC) in predicting fluid responsiveness in obese (BMI {$\geq$}30 kg/m2) patients in the prone position. METHODS: A total of 33 patients undergoing neurosurgery were included. After standardized anesthesia induction, patients' PPV, SVV, stroke volume index (SVI) and CS values were recorded in the prone position (T1), after the infusion of 100 mL of crystalloid named as MFC (T2) and after fluid loading was completed with additional 400 mL of crystalloid. Patients whose SVI increased more than 15\% after the fluid loading were defined as volume responders. RESULTS: Fifteen (45\%) patients were responders to 500 mL fluid loading. After the 100 mL fluid load, a higher percentage increase in SVI was observed among responders (P{$<$}0.001), with values of 6.6\% (6.2-8.6\%) and 3.5\% (1.7-4.8\%) in responders and non-responders, respectively. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of MFC, PPV, and SVV were 0.967 (95\% CI: 0.838-0.999), 0.683 (95\% CI: 0.499-0.834), and 0.709 (95\% CI: 0.526-0.853), respectively. The area under the curve of MFC was significantly higher than that of PPV (P=0.003) and SVV (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in SVI after a rapid infusion of 100 mL crystalloid could predict fluid responsiveness in patients with BMI {$\geq$}30 kg/m2 in the prone position.

Nevertheless, most conditions in critical care force to use lower Vt. Thus, we sought to evaluate the operative performance of PPV when a Vt ?8?mL?kg?1 is used during mechanical ventilation support.Methods:We searched PubMed and Embase databases for articles evaluating the operative performance of PPV as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in critical care and perioperative adult patients ventilated with tidal volume ?8?mL?kg?1 without respiratory effort and arrhythmias, between January 1990 and January 2019. We included cohort and cross-sectional studies. Two authors performed an Independently selection using predefined terms of search. The fitted data of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were assessed by bivariate and hierarchical analyses.Results:We retrieved 19 trials with a total of 777 patients and a total of 935 fluid challenges. The fitted sensitivity of PPV to predict fluid responsiveness during mechanical ventilation at Vt ?8?mL?kg?1 was 0.65 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.73), the specificity was 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.73-0.84), and the AUC was 0.75.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the agreement between two noninvasive methods, magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping and first-pass radionuclide angiography, to quantify the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (QP/QS) in adults, adolescents, and children with left-to-right cardiac shunts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The accuracy and precision of MR velocity mapping were studied in 12 control subjects (six men, six women) and in a phantom. MR velocity mapping and radionuclide angiography were performed on the same day in 24 patients (16 adults, two adolescents, six children; five male patients, 19 female patients). RESULTS: The mean error in QP/QS at MR velocity mapping in phantom experiments was -1\% {$\pm$} 1 (mean {$\pm$} SD). In control subjects, QP/QS at MR velocity mapping was 1.03 {$\pm$} 0.03, and the cardiac index was 3.1 L/min/m2 {$\pm$} 0.2 and 3.2 L/min/m2 {$\pm$} 0.3 for women and men, respectively. In patients, QP/QS at radionuclide angiography was 14\% {$\pm$} 13, higher than at MR velocity mapping. Interobserver variability was four times higher for radionuclide angiography compared with MR velocity mapping, 0\% {$\pm$} 16 versus 0\% {$\pm$} 4 (n = 12). The difference between repeated MR flow measurements in the same vessel was -1\% {$\pm$} 5 (n = 36). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that MR velocity mapping is accurate and precise for measurements of shunt size over the whole range of possible QP/QS values.},

The utility of this test during low-tidal-volume ventilation remains uncertain. This study aimed to determine whether hemodynamic variations induced by EEOT could predict the effect of volume expansion in patients with protective ventilation in the operating room.         METHODS:~         Forty-one patients undergoing neurosurgery were included. Stroke volume and pulse pressure variations were continuously recorded using pulse contour analysis before and immediately after a 30-second EEOT and after volume expansion (250 mL saline 0.9\% given over 10 minutes). Patients with an increase in stroke volume {$\geq$} 10\% after volume expansion were defined as responders.         RESULTS:~         Twenty patients were responders to fluid administration. EEOT induced a significant increase in stroke volume, which was correlated with the stroke volume changes induced by volume expansion (r2 = 0.55, P {$<$} .0001). A 5\% increase in stroke volume during EEOT discriminated responders to volume expansion with a sensitivity of 100\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 83\%\textendash 100\%), a specificity of 81\% (95\% CI, 58\%\textendash 95\%), a positive predictive value of 84\% (95\% CI, 64\%\textendash 96\%), and a negative predictive value of 100\% (95\% CI, 80\%\textendash 100\%). The gray zone ranged from 4\% to 8\%, including 17\% of patients. The best pulse pressure variation threshold was 9\%, with a sensitivity of 60\% (95\% CI, 36\%\textendash 81\%) and specificity of 86\% (95\% CI, 64\%\textendash 97\%).

Methods: A total of 44 mechanically ventilated patients undergoing neurosurgery were included. Volume expansion (250\,ml saline 0.9\%) was given to maximize cardiac output during surgery. Stroke volume index (monitored using pulse contour analysis) and pulse pressure variations were recorded before and after 50\,ml infusion (given for 1\,min), after another 50\,ml infusion (given for 1\,min), and finally after 150\,ml infusion (total = 250\,ml).

In recent years, the PAC evolved from a device that enabled intermittent cardiac output measurements in combination with static pressures to a monitoring tool that provides continuous data on cardiac output, oxygen supply and-demand balance, as well as right ventricular performance. In this review, which consists of two parts, we will introduce the difference between intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution using bolus injections, and the contemporary PAC enabling continuous measurements by using a thermal filament which heats up the blood. In this second part, we will discuss in detail the measurements of the contemporary PAC, including continuous cardiac output measurement, right ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Limitations of all of these measurements are highlighted as well. We conclude that thorough understanding of measurements obtained from the PAC is the first step in successful application of the PAC in daily clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Respiratory variations in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (DeltaPOP) are related to respiratory variations in pulse pressure (DeltaPP) and are sensitive to changes in preload. The authors hypothesized that DeltaPOP can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients during general anesthesia.Twenty-five patients referred for cardiac surgery were studied after induction of general anesthesia. Hemodynamic data (cardiac index, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, DeltaPP, and DeltaPOP) were recorded before and after volume expansion (500 ml hetastarch, 6\%). Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac index of 15\% or greater.Volume expansion induced changes in cardiac index (2.0+/-0.4 to 2.3+/-0.5 mmHg; P\&lt;0.05), DeltaPP (11+/-7 to 6+/-5\%; P\&lt;0.05), and DeltaPOP (12+/-9 to 7+/-5\%; P\&lt;0.05). DeltaPOP and DeltaPP were higher in responders than in nonresponders (17+/-8 vs. 6+/-4 and 14+/-7 vs. 6+/-4\%, respectively; P\&lt;0.05 for both). A DeltaPOP greater than 13\% before volume expansion allowed discrimination between responders and nonresponders with 80\% sensitivity and 90\% specificity. There was a significant relation between DeltaPOP before volume expansion and percent change in cardiac index after volume expansion (r=0.62; P\&lt;0.05).DeltaPOP can predict fluid responsiveness noninvasively in mechanically ventilated patients during general anesthesia. This index has potential clinical applications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Fluid challenges (FCs) are one of the most commonly used therapies in critically ill patients and represent the cornerstone of hemodynamic management in intensive care units. There are clear benefits and harms from fluid therapy. Limited data on the indication, type, amount and rate of an FC in critically ill patients exist in the literature. The primary aim was to evaluate how physicians conduct FCs in terms of type, volume, and rate of given fluid; the secondary aim was to evaluate variables used to trigger an FC and to compare the proportion of patients receiving further fluid administration based on the response to the FC. METHODS This was an observational study conducted in ICUs around the world. Each participating unit entered a maximum of 20 patients with one FC. RESULTS 2213 patients were enrolled and analyzed in the study. The median [interquartile range] amount of fluid given during an FC was 500 ml (500-1000). The median time was 24 min (40-60 min), and the median rate of FC was 1000 [500-1333] ml/h. The main indication for FC was hypotension in 1211 (59\%, CI 57-61\%). In 43\% (CI 41-45\%) of the cases no hemodynamic variable was used. Static markers of preload were used in 785 of 2213 cases (36\%, CI 34-37\%). Dynamic indices of preload responsiveness were used in 483 of 2213 cases (22\%, CI 20-24\%). No safety variable for the FC was used in 72\% (CI 70-74\%) of the cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who received further fluids after the FC between those with a positive, with an uncertain or with a negatively judged response. CONCLUSIONS The current practice and evaluation of FC in critically ill patients are highly variable. Prediction of fluid responsiveness is not used routinely, safety limits are rarely used, and information from previous failed FCs is not always taken into account.},

  abstract = {Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) and volume loading (VL) are standard blood-sparing procedures. However, VL is associated with hypervolemia, which may cause tissue edema, cardiopulmonary complications and a prolonged hospital stay. The body reacts to hypervolemia with release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from the heart. ANP has been shown to deteriorate the endothelial glycocalyx, a vital part of the vascular permeability barrier. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare ANP release and damage to the glycocalyx during ANH and VL. ANH or VL with 6\% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 was administered prior to elective surgery in patients of good cardiopulmonary health (n =9 in each group). We measured concentrations of ANP in plasma and of three main constituent parts of the glycocalyx (hyaluronan, heparan sulfate and syndecan 1) in serum before and after ANH or VL. Heparan sulfate and syndecan 1 levels in urine were also determined. In contrast to ANH, VL (20 ml/kg) induced a significant release of ANP (approximately +100\%, P {$<$}0.05) and increased the serum concentration of two glycocalyx constituents, hyaluronan and syndecan 1 (both by about 80\%, P {$<$}0.05). Elevation of syndecan 1 was also detected in the urine of patients undergoing VL, but no increase was found in patients undergoing ANH. Heparan sulfate levels were not influenced by either procedure. These data suggest that hypervolemia increases the release of ANP and causes enhanced shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx. This perturbation must be expected to impair the vascular barrier, implying that VL may not be as safe as generally assumed and that it should be critically evaluated.},

  abstract = {On the basis of the windkessel model, the stroke volume-to-aortic pulse pressure ratio (SV/PP) has been proposed as an estimate of total arterial compliance, but recent studies have questioned this approximation. Aortic pressure was obtained at rest in 31 adults undergoing cardiac catheterization (47 +/- 14 yr): controls (n = 7), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 10), and patients with other cardiac diseases (n = 14). We calculated PP, mean aortic pressure (MAoP), heart period (T), SV (thermodilution cardiac output/heart rate), total peripheral resistance (R), total arterial compliance estimated by area method (Carea), and the time constant of aortic pressure decay in diastole (RCarea). In the overall population (n = 31), there was no significant difference between SV/PP and Carea. SV/PP was linearly related to Carea (SV/PP = 0.99Carea + 0.05; r = 0.98; P {$<$} 0.001); the slope and intercept did not differ from unity and zero, respectively. Similar results were obtained in the three subgroups. These results implied that PP/MAoP and T/RCarea were proportionally related (T/RCarea = 1.18PP/MAoP - 0.07; r = 0.96; P {$<$} 0.001). We conclude that for humans at rest 1) SV/PP gave a reliable estimate of Carea, and 2) T normalized by the time constant of aortic pressure decay in diastole was proportionally related to PP/MAoP. This last relationship could be considered an aspect of the coupling between the left ventricle and its load.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:~         Both ``liberal'' and ``goal-directed'' (GD) therapy use a large amount of perioperative fluid, but they appear to have very different effects on perioperative outcomes. We sought to determine whether one fluid management strategy was superior to the others.         METHODS:~         We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of GD or restrictive versus liberal fluid therapy (LVR) in major adult surgery from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed (1951 to April 2011), and Cochrane controlled trials register without language restrictions. Indirect comparison between the GD and LVR strata was performed.         RESULTS:~         A total of 3861 patients from 23 GD RCTs (median sample size = 90, interquartile range [IQR] 57 to 109) and 1160 patients from 12 LVR RCTs (median sample size = 80, IQR36 to 151) were considered. Both liberal and GD therapy used more fluid compared to their respective comparative arm, but their effects on outcomes were very different. Patients in the liberal group of the LVR stratum had a higher risk of pneumonia (risk ratio [RR] 2.2, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 4.5), pulmonary edema (RR 3.8, 95\% CI 1.1 to 13), and a longer hospital stay than those in the restrictive group (mean difference [MD] 2 days, 95\% CI 0.5 to 3.4). Using GD therapy also resulted in a lower risk of pneumonia (RR 0.7, 95\% CI 0.6 to 0.9) and renal complications (0.7, 95\% CI 0.5 to 0.9), and a shorter length of hospital stay (MD 2 days, 95\% CI 1 to 3) compared to not using GD therapy. Liberal fluid therapy was associated with an increased length of hospital stay (4 days, 95\% CI 3.4 to 4.4), time to first bowel movement (2 days, 95\% CI 1.3 to 2.3), and risk of pneumonia (RR ratio 3, 95\% CI 1.8 to 4.8) compared to GD therapy.         CONCLUSION:~         Perioperative outcomes favored a GD therapy rather than liberal fluid therapy without hemodynamic goals. Whether GD therapy is superior to a restrictive fluid strategy remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {As suggested by experimental studies, systolic pressure variation (SPV), the difference between maximum and minimum values of systolic blood pressure after a single positive pressure breath, may be a fair indicator of left ventricular preload. SPV was quantified in 21 patients who had undergone abdominal aortic surgery and were sedated under mechanical ventilation. The aim of the study was to assess the ability of this parameter to qualitatively estimate left ventricular preload measured using transesophageal echocardiography. All patients had preoperative radionuclide ejection fraction {$>$}45\%. Postoperative mechanical ventilatory patterns were the same for all patients: tidal volume = 10 mL/kg; respiratory frequency = 12\textendash 14 breathsimin; and zero end-expiratory pressure mode. Left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole correlated well with the magnitude of both SPV (r = 0.80) and its delta down (dDown) component (i.e., the degree by which systolic pressure decreases with each mechanical breath) (r = 0.83). Once the first measurement was completed, volume loading with two increments of 250 mL of human albumin 5\% was performed in all but three patients. Each volume loading step caused a significant increase in the end-diastolic area (EDa) index (7.0 {$\pm$} 1.6 to 8.5 {$\pm$} 1.6 cm2/m2) and cardiac index (CI) (3.1 {$\pm$} 0.9 to 4.1 {$\pm$} 0.9 L.min-1{$\cdot$}m-2) and a concomitant significant decrease in the SPV (8.6 {$\pm$} 4.5 to 6.1 {$\pm$} 3.7 mm Hg) and its dDown component (5.9 {$\pm$} 4.1 to 2.9 {$\pm$} 2 mm Hg). The initial (preinfusion) dDown values showed a significant linear correlation to the increase in EDa (r = 0.63) and CI (r = 0.55) in response to the infusion of 500 mL of colloid solution. Thus the higher the initial dDown, the greater was the change in EDa and CI after volume loading. These findings confirm the results of animal studies that demonstrate the usefulness of SPV to estimate left ventricular filling. They suggest that, in mechanically ventilated patients after vascular noncardiac surgery, pressure waveform analysis is a simple means of cardiovascular assessment that provides reliable information concerning preload estimation and the response to left ventricular volume loading.},

  abstract = {Numerous cardiac output (CO) monitors have been produced that provide continuous rather than intermittent readings. Bland and Altman has become the standard method for validating their performance against older standards. However, the Bland and Altman method only assesses precision and does not assess how well a device detects serial changes in CO (trending ability). Currently, there is no consensus on how trending ability, or trend analysis, should be performed. Therefore, we performed a literature review to identify articles published between 1997 and 2009 that compared methods of continuous CO measurement. Identified articles were grouped according to measurement technique and statistical methodology. Articles that analyzed trending ability were reviewed with the aim of finding an acceptable statistical method. Two hundred two articles were identified. The most popular methods were pulse contour (69 articles), Doppler (54), bioimpedance (38), and transpulmonary or continuous thermodilution (27). Forty-one articles addressed trending, and of these only 23 provided an in-depth analysis. Several common statistical themes were identified: time plots, regression analysis, Bland and Altman using change in CO ({$\Delta$}CO), and the 4-quadrant plot, which used direction of change of {$\Delta$}CO to determine the concordance. This plot was further refined by exclusion of data when values were small. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to define the exclusion zone. In animal studies, a reliable reference standard such as an aortic flowprobe was frequently used, and regression or time plots could be used to show trending. Clinical studies were more problematic because data collection points were fewer (8\textendash 10 per subject). The consensus was to use the 4-quadrant plot with exclusion zones and apply concordance analysis. A concordance rate of {$>$}92\% when using a 15\% zone indicated good trending. A new method of presenting trend data ({$\Delta$}CO) on a polar plot is proposed. Agreement was shown by the angle with the horizontal axis and {$\Delta$}CO by the distance from the center. Trending can be assessed by the vertical limits of the data, similar to the Bland and Altman method.},

Contradictory results regarding ANP and glycocalyx degradation have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate if an infusion of ANP causes degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx. Methods Twenty pigs, pretreated with 250 mg methylprednisolone, were randomized to receive an infusion of either ANP (50 ng/kg/min) (n = 10) or 0.9\% NaCl (n = 10) during 60 min. Endothelial glycocalyx components (heparan sulphate proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid), Hct, calculated plasma volume and colloid osmotic pressure were measured from baseline to 60 min. Results There was no difference between the control and intervention groups for heparan sulphate proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid corrected for the change in plasma volume (P = .333 and 0.197). Hct increased with 1.8 {$\pm$} 2.2\% in the intervention group (P = .029) with no change -0.5 {$\pm$} 2.3\% in the control group (P = .504). The plasma volume decreased in the intervention group with -8.4 {$\pm$} 10\% (P = .034) with no change in the control group 3.1 {$\pm$} 12\% (P = .427). Median changes in colloid osmotic pressures in the control and intervention group were -0.39 [95\% CI, -1.88-0.13] and 0.9 [95\% CI, 0.00-1.58], respectively (P = .012). Conclusions In this randomized porcine study, an ANP infusion did not cause endothelial glycocalyx degradation but decreased the plasma volume most probably due to precapillary vasodilation and increased filtration.},

Thus, volume status, risks and potential efficacy of fluid administration and/or removal should be carefully evaluated, and monitoring techniques help for this purpose. Central venous pressure is a marker of right ventricular preload. Very low values indicate hypovolemia, while extremely high values suggest fluid harmfulness. The pulmonary artery catheter enables a comprehensive assessment of the hemodynamic profile and is particularly useful for indicating the risk of pulmonary oedema through the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Besides cardiac output and preload, transpulmonary thermodilution measures extravascular lung water, which reflects the extent of lung flooding and assesses the risk of fluid infusion. Echocardiography estimates the volume status through intravascular volumes and pressures. Finally, lung ultrasound estimates lung edema. Guided by these variables, the decision to infuse fluid should first consider specific triggers, such as signs of tissue hypoperfusion. Second, benefits and risks of fluid infusion should be weighted. Thereafter, fluid responsiveness should be assessed. Monitoring techniques help for this purpose, especially by providing real time and precise measurements of cardiac output. When decided, fluid resuscitation should be performed through fluid challenges, the effects of which should be assessed through critical endpoints including cardiac output. This comprehensive evaluation of the risk, benefits and efficacy of fluid infusion helps to individualize fluid management, which should be preferred over a fixed restrictive or liberal strategy.},

SETTING: A 31-bed university hospital medico-surgical ICU. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty mechanically ventilated critically ill patients requiring fluid challenge, separated according to their tidal volume. INTERVENTION: Fluid challenge with either 1,000 ml crystalloids or 500 ml colloids. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Complete hemodynamic measurements including DeltaPP were obtained before and after fluid challenge. Tidal volume was lower than 7 ml/kg in 26 patients, between 7-8 ml/kg in 9 patients, and greater than 8 ml/kg in 27 patients. ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of DeltaPP at different tidal volume thresholds, and 8 ml/kg best identified different behaviors. Overall, the cardiac index increased from 2.66 (2.00-3.47) to 3.04 (2.44-3.96) l/min m(2) ( P {$<$}0.001). It increased by more than 15\% in 33 patients (fluid responders). Pulmonary artery occluded pressure was lower and DeltaPP higher in responders than in non-responders, but fluid responsiveness was better predicted with DeltaPP (ROC curve area 0.76+/-0.06) than with pulmonary artery occluded pressure (0.71+/-0.07) and right atrial (0.56+/-0.08) pressures. Despite similar response to fluid challenge in low ({$<$}8 ml/kg) and high tidal volume groups, the percent of correct classification of a 12\% DeltaPP was 51\% in the low tidal volume group and 88\% in the high tidal volume group. CONCLUSIONS: DeltaPP is a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients only when tidal volume is at least 8 ml/kg.},

  abstract = {Introduction Postoperative morbidity and mortality in older patients with comorbidities undergoing gastrointestinal surgery are a major burden on healthcare systems. Infections after surgery are common in such patients, prolonging hospitalisation and reducing postoperative short-term and long-term survival. Optimal management of perioperative intravenous fluids and inotropic drugs may reduce infection rates and improve outcomes from surgery. Previous small trials of cardiac-output-guided haemodynamic therapy algorithms suggested a modest reduction in postoperative morbidity. A large definitive trial is needed to confirm or refute this and inform widespread clinical practice. Methods The Optimisation of Perioperative Cardiovascular Management to Improve Surgical Outcome II (OPTIMISE II) trial is a multicentre, international, parallel group, open, randomised controlled trial. 2502 high-risk patients undergoing major elective gastrointestinal surgery will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using minimisation to minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring to guide protocolised administration of intravenous fluid combined with low-dose inotrope infusion, or usual care. The trial intervention will be carried out during and for 4 hours after surgery. The primary outcome is postoperative infection of Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher within 30 days of randomisation. Participants and those delivering the intervention will not be blinded to treatment allocation; however, outcome assessors will be blinded when feasible. Participant recruitment started in January 2017 and is scheduled to last 3 years, within 50 hospitals worldwide. Ethics/dissemination The OPTIMISE II trial has been approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service and has been approved by responsible ethics committees in all participating countries. The findings will be disseminated through publication in a widely accessible peer-reviewed scientific journal. Trial registration number ISRCTN39653756.},

Design Prospective clinical study. Setting Anesthesia for cardiac surgery, operating room, single-center university hospital. Participants Twenty-five patients were included. After exclusion, 20 patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement were analyzed. Interventions After induction of general anesthesia, CCO-FT and CCO-PAC values were recorded every 30 seconds before and after aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Measurements and Main Results Data were analyzed separately from skin incision to last suture and before and after CPB. Regression analyses, Bland-Altman analyses, and trending analyses (4-quadrant plot, polar plot) were performed. The percentage errors of the FloTrac/EV1000 were 69.7\% and 59.3\% before and after CPB, respectively. The concordance rates (CRs) and angular CRs of the FloTrac/EV1000 were 50.9\% and 57.1\%, and 48.7\% and 61.9\% before and after CPB, respectively. Conclusion This study revealed a low level of agreement and poor trending ability of the FloTrac/EV1000 system compared to continuous thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

The MFC method is meant to predict if a patient will respond to a subsequent, larger fluid challenge, typically another 400 ml, with a significant increase in stroke volume. Methods We critically evaluated the general methodology of MFC studies, with statistical considerations, secondary analysis of an existing study and simulations. Results Secondary analysis of an existing study showed that the MFC could predict the total fluid response (MFC + 400 ml) with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92, but that the prediction was worse than random for the response to the remaining 400 ml (AUROC = 0.33). In a null simulation with no response to both the MFC and the subsequent fluid challenge, the commonly used analysis could predict fluid responsiveness with an AUROC of 0.73. Conclusion Many existing MFC studies are likely overestimating the classification accuracy of the MFC. This should be considered before adopting the MFC into clinical practice. A better study design includes a second, independent measurement of stroke volume after the MFC. This measurement serves as reference for the response to the subsequent fluid challenge.},

Often, the cardiac effect is the primary interest, but for, e.g., fluid responsiveness prediction, the respiratory effect on arterial blood pressure also convey important information. In either case, it is relevant to disentangle the two effects. Generalized additive models (GAMs) allow estimating the effect of predictors as nonlinear, smooth functions. These smooth functions can represent the cardiac and respiratory cycles' effects on a physiological signal. We demonstrate how GAMs allow a decomposition of physiological signals from mechanically ventilated subjects into separate effects of the cardiac and respiratory cycles. Two examples are presented. The first is a model of the respiratory variation in pulse pressure. The second demonstrates how a central venous pressure waveform can be decomposed into a cardiac effect, a respiratory effect and the interaction between the two cycles. Generalized additive models provide an intuitive and flexible approach to modelling the repeating, smooth, patterns common in medical monitoring data.},

In other words, 100 continuous observations are statistically equivalent to 158 dichotomized observations. The amount of information lost depends greatly on the prior choice of cut points, with the optimal cut point depending upon the unknown parameters. The loss of information leads to loss of power or conversely a sample size increase to maintain power. Only in certain cases, for instance, in estimating a value of the cumulative distribution function and when the assumed model is very different from the true model, can the use of dichotomized outcomes be considered a reasonable approach.

Each day, over 20\% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30\% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are `normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.},

On the 3 December 1831 a Dr W B O'Shaughnessy delivered a lecture to the Westminster Medical Society on the ``Blue epidemic cholera'', as it was then known. As there was still no known ``remote'' cause of the disease, he considered it legitimate to look at the effects of the disease and to treat these instead. He had observed that, ``universal stagnation of the venous system, and rapid cessation of the arterialisation of the blood, are the earliest, as well as the most characteristic effects.''2 He then posed the question, ``What is the best mode by which this artificial arterialisation can be effected ..?'' At the time most physicians favoured venesection. Others, ``Recommend the inhalation of oxygen gas, or of a mixture of oxygen and atmospheric air, or of the protoxide of azote, ... ``laughing gas''...''2 He went on, ``Now it might rationally be imagined that the success or failure of these methods should afford us a touchstone of some authority, in deciding on the rationality of the principles on which they are practised ...''2 and concluded that there was some evidence in favour of venesection, if done in time and no other problems were encountered. He found no evidence in favour of oxygenation and conceded that venesection might also fail. In vitro physiology studies had shown that venous blood could be arterialised by agitation in atmospheric air, or contact with highly oxygenised solids or fluids. This led him to suggest the idea of intravenous injection of nitrate or \ldots},

Design: Single-center pilot prospective observational study. Setting: City Hospital \#1 of Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation. Participants: Thirty-two adult patients after off-pump coronary artery surgery. Interventions: To assess fluid responsiveness, after arrival to the intensive care unit, all patients received a test with increase in positive endexpiratory pressure from 5 to 20 cmH2O for 2 minutes, a mini-fluid challenge test with administration of crystalloids at 1.5 mL/kg during 2 minutes, and standard fluid challenge test using 7 mL/kg during 10 minutes. Measurements and Main Results: The patients with an increase in cardiac index by  15\% after a standard fluid challenge test were defined as fluid responders. According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, a decrease in mean arterial pressure exceeding 5 mmHg in 120 seconds of the positive end-expiratory pressure test identified fluid responsiveness with an area under the curve of 0.73 (p = 0.03). The reduction in pulse pressure and stroke volume variations by more than 2\% during mini-fluid challenge test predicted positive response to fluid load with an area under the curve of 0.77 and 0.75, respectively (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: Both the positive end-expiratory pressure test and the mini-fluid challenge test are feasible after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and can be used to predict fluid responsiveness in these patients. \'O 2019 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Scientific interest in mechanosensation likely commenced with Aristotle's description of the sense of touch in his treatise de Anima [On the Soul]. Considering touch as a vital sense distributed over the whole body, the philosopher outlined a ``physiological concept'' at the macro-level already 2400 years ago. From this starting point, we outline the onset of modern sensory physiology during the early 19th century. Physiologists distinguished between outer and inner senses at that time, without, however, referring to specific receptors or nerves. We then outline how research on four topics concerning cardiac mechano-electric coupling developed up until the 1960's (cardio-respiratory coupling, Bainbridge reflex, Bezold-Jarisch reflex, stretch-induced arrhythmias). Following the discovery of macroscopic phenomena (e.g. change of heart rate, induced by atrial distension) during that period, researchers sought to identify the pertinent receptors and reflex loops, while nowadays the underlying subcellular mechanisms such as stretch-activated ion channels are under investigation. In this chapter, the changes that occur with aging in central aortic hemodynamics are discussed. With each contraction of the heart, a forward pressure and flow wave are generated, which travel down the arterial tree, giving rise to reflections and complex dynamic interaction with the distensible vessels. We first discuss cardiac contraction and heart\textendash vessel interaction, considering both the ventricular\textendash arterial elastance matching framework and recent insights based on time domain interpretation of ventricular\textendash vascular coupling. Second, the current knowledge on the evolution of wave reflection with aging is presented, which summarizes impedance and wave separation analysis and relates this to integrative markers of wave reflection such as the augmentation index. Finally, age-related changes of central arterial pressure are discussed, and both carotid applanation tonometry and mathematical transformation of radial/brachial artery signals into a central pressure wave are considered. Acute myocardial stretch elicits a biphasic increase in contractility: an immediate increase, known as Frank\textendash Starling mechanism (FSM), followed by a progressive increase, regarded as slow force response (SFR). In this study, we characterized the contractile response to acute stretch from 92 to 100\% Lmax in rabbit papillary muscles (n = 86) under normoxic and ischemic conditions, and its modulation by angiotensin II signaling pathway. Under normoxia, the FSM was independent of Na+/H+-exchanger, reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (r-NCX), AT1 receptor, AT2 receptor and PKC. Regarding the SFR, it was mediated by AT1 receptor activation and its downstream effectors PKC, Na+/H+-exchanger and r-NCX. Ischemia negatively impacted on the FSM and abolished the SFR, with the muscles exhibiting a time-dependent decline in contractility. Under ischemic conditions, FSM was not influenced by AT1 and AT2 receptors or PKC activation. AT1 receptor antagonism rescued the progressive deterioration in contractility, an effect partially dependent on AT2 receptor activation.},

DESIGN: Prospective, observational clinical study. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a single-center, teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 22 adult patients after elective coronary artery bypass surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Three measurement cycles were performed in all patient durings their immediate postoperative intensive care stay before and after fluid loading. Hemodynamic measurements were performed 5 minutes before and immediately after the administration of 500 mL colloidal fluid over 20 minutes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCCO, LCCO, FCCO, and NCCO were assessed and compared with cardiac output derived from intermittent transpulmonary thermodilution (ICO). One hundred thirty-two matched sets of data were available for analysis. Bland-Altman analysis using linear mixed effects models with random effects for patient and trial revealed a mean bias {$\pm$}2 standard deviation (\%error) of -0.86 {$\pm$} 1.41 L/min (34.9\%) for PCCO-ICO, -0.26 {$\pm$} 2.81 L/min (46.3\%) for LCCO-ICO, -0.28 {$\pm$} 2.39 L/min (43.7\%) for FCCO-ICO, and -0.93 {$\pm$} 2.25 L/min (34.6\%) for NCCO-ICO. Bland-Altman plots without adjustment for repeated measurements and replicates yielded considerably larger limits of agreement. Trend analysis for all techniques did not meet criteria for acceptable performance. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 tested devices using pulse wave analysis for measuring cardiac output failed to meet current criteria for meaningful and adequate accuracy, precision, and trending ability in cardiac output monitoring.},

Simulations show that a prolongation of the T1/2 for crystalloid fluid increases the plasma volume and promotes accumulation of fluid in the interstitial fluid space. The T1/2 for crystalloids is usually 20 to 40 min in conscious humans but might extend to 80 min or longer in the presence of preoperative stress, dehydration, blood loss of {$<$}1 l or pregnancy.         The longest T1/2 measured amounts to between 3 and 8 h and occurs during surgery and general anaesthesia with mechanical ventilation. This situation lasts as long as the anaesthesia. The mechanisms for the long T1/2 are only partly understood, but involve adrenergic receptors and increased renin and aldosterone release. In contrast, the T1/2 during the postoperative period is usually short, about 15 to 20 min, at least in response to new fluid.         The commonly used colloid fluids have an intravascular persistence T1/2 of 2 to 3 h, which is shortened by inflammation. The fact that the elimination T1/2 of the infused macromolecules is 2 to 6 times longer shows that they also reside outside the bloodstream. With a colloid, fluid volume is eliminated in line with its intravascular persistence, but there is insufficient data to know if this is the same in the clinical setting.},

The approach is a modification of drug pharmacokinetics and uses repeated measurements of blood hemoglobin and urinary excretion as input variables in (usually) a two-compartment model with expandable walls. Study results show that crystalloid fluid has a distribution phase that gives these fluids a plasma volume expansion amounting to 50\%-60\% of the infused volume as long as the infusion lasts, while the fraction is reduced to 15\%-20\% within 30 minutes after the infusion ends. Small volumes of crystalloid barely distribute to the interstitium, whereas rapid infusions tend to cause edema. Fluid elimination is very slow during general anesthesia due to the vasodilatation-induced reduction of the arterial pressure, whereas elimination is less affected by hemorrhage. The half-life is twice as long for saline than for Ringer solutions. Elimination is slower in conscious males than conscious females, and high red blood cell and thrombocyte counts retard both distribution and re-distribution. Children have faster turnover than adults. Plasma volume expansions are similar for glucose solutions and Ringer's, but the expansion duration is shorter for glucose. Concentrated urine before and during infusion slows down the elimination of crystalloid fluid. Colloid fluids have no distribution phase, an intravascular persistence half-life of 2-3 hours, and\textemdash at least for hydroxyethyl starch\textemdash the ability to reduce the effect of subsequently infused crystalloids. Accelerated distribution due to degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx layer has not yet been demonstrated.},

Design~         Criterion standard study.         Setting~         Multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a university hospital.         Patients~         Fourteen critically ill patients, with different diseases, requiring pulmonary artery catheterization.         Interventions~         In two patients with a left ventricular assist system, a defined, sudden 1 L/min change in cardiac output was carried through to evaluate the in vivo response time of the continuous cardiac output monitoring system. In the remaining 12 patients, cardiac output was altered by varying the dose of catecholamines, by volume loading, or by varying the level of sedation. In four patients, a rapid infusion of cold saline was given through a central venous catheter to test the performance of the system under these conditions.         Measurements and Main Results~         Cardiac output was monitored continuously. A total of 163 (13 to 18 per patient) bolus determinations of cardiac output were performed, using the conventional thermodilution technique and simultaneously using the indocyanine green dye dilution technique. The range of cardiac output was 3.8 to 15.6 L/min. The results of the continuous thermodilution method were compared with the results of the bolus thermodilution and the dye dilution methods, respectively. The mean difference (bias) +/- SD of differences (precision) was 0.35 +/- 1.01 L/min for continuous vs. bolus thermodilution and 0.34 +/- 1.01 L/min for continuous thermodilution vs. indocyanine green dye dilution. Linear regression (correlation) analyses were y = 0.95x + 0.76 (r2 = .91) for continuous and bolus thermodilution and y = 0.93x + 0.87 (r2 = .91) for continuous thermodilution and dye dilution. The 75\% in vivo response time was 10.5 mins. The infusion of cold isotonic saline led to erroneous continuous cardiac output values. When the conventional bolus thermodilution and dye dilution techniques were compared, mean difference was -0.01 +/- 0.54 L/min and the results of linear regression analyses were y = 0.97x + 0.22 (r2 = .97).         Conclusions~         Continuous cardiac output measurement using the thermodilution technique is reasonably accurate and is reliable and applicable in routine clinical practice, and therefore may add to patient safety. However, the response time is too slow for the immediate detection of acute changes in cardiac output. Some clinical conditions such as the rapid infusion of cold solutions can interfere with the continuous cardiac output measurement. Conventional bolus thermodilution and indocyanine green dye dilution methods showed good agreement and can be used interchangeably.         (Crit Care Med 1995; 23:860-866)},

The precision of agreement depends on the precision of each method, i.e., the precision that the studied and the reference technique are able to achieve. We call this ``precision of method''. A decomposition of variance shows that method agreement does not only depend on the precision of method but also on another important source of variability, i.e., the method's general variability about the true values. Ignorance of that fact leads to falsified conclusions about the precision of method of the studied technique. In CO studies, serial measurements are frequently confused with repeated measurements. But as the actual CO of a subject changes from assessment to assessment, there is no real repetition of a measurement. This situation equals a scenario in which single measurements are given for multiple true values per subject. In such a case it is not possible to assess the precision of method.},

We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form {$\sum$} {$\beta$}\textsubscript{jX}\textsubscript{j} by a sum of smooth functions {$\sum$} s\textsubscript{j}(X\textsubscript{j}). The s\textsubscript{j}({$\cdot$})'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor {$\eta$} = {$\Sigma$} {$\beta$}\textsubscript{jX}\textsubscript{j} is replaced by the additive predictor {$\Sigma$} s\textsubscript{j}(X\textsubscript{j}); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.}

While the correct use of i.v. fluids can be lifesaving, recent literature demonstrates that fluid therapy is not without risks. Indeed, the use of certain types and volumes of fluid can increase the risk of harm, and even death, in some patient groups. Data from a recent audit show us that the inappropriate use of fluids may occur in up to 20\% of patients receiving fluid therapy. The delegates of the 12th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Conference sought to obtain consensus on the use of i.v. fluids with the aim of producing guidance for their use. In this article, we review a recently proposed model for fluid therapy in severe sepsis and propose a framework by which it could be adopted for use in most situations where fluid management is required. Considering the dose\textendash effect relationship and side-effects of fluids, fluid therapy should be regarded similar to other drug therapy with specific indications and tailored recommendations for the type and dose of fluid. By emphasizing the necessity to individualize fluid therapy, we hope to reduce the risk to our patients and improve their outcome.},

The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, this component is highly vulnerable to damage and is also difficult to examine. Recent advances in analytical techniques have enabled biochemical, visual and computational investigation of this vascular component. The glycocalyx modulates leukocyte\textendash endothelial interactions, thrombus formation and other processes that lead to microcirculatory dysfunction and critical organ injury in sepsis. It also acts as a regulator of vascular permeability and contains mechanosensors as well as receptors for growth factors and anticoagulants. During the initial onset of sepsis, the glycocalyx is damaged and circulating levels of glycocalyx components, including syndecans, heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid, can be measured and are reportedly useful as biomarkers for sepsis. Also, a new methodology using side-stream dark-field imaging is now clinically available for assessing the glycocalyx. Multiple factors including hypervolemia and hyperglycemia are toxic to the glycocalyx, and several agents have been proposed as therapeutic modalities, although no single treatment has been proven to be clinically effective. In this article, we review the derangement of the glycocalyx in sepsis. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the important roles of the glycocalyx, the relationship between derangement of the endothelial glycocalyx and severity of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been adequately elucidated and further work is needed.},

Therefore, perioperative fluid regimens were traditionally based on a generous replacement of this assumed primary loss, in addition to deficits due to insensible perspiration and fasting. The practical consequence was an extremely positive fluid balance in order to maintain blood volume during major surgery. Whereas the insensible perspiration and the preoperative deficits are in fact often negligible, and the third space appears to be only a fictional construct, the excess fluid most likely accumulates interstitially. Such shifting is related to a destruction of the endothelial glycocalyx, a key structure of the vascular barrier, by traumatic inflammation and iatrogenic hypervolaemia. This explains why patients undergoing major surgical interventions benefit significantly from an infusion regimen which does not substitute but avoids 'third-space shifting'. In summary, eradicating this notion from our minds could be a further key to achieving perioperative fluid optimisation.},

Methods Included clinical trials investigated goal-directed haemodynamic therapy during general anaesthesia in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery and reported at least one patient-centred postoperative outcome. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant articles on March 8, 2021. Two investigators performed abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and bias assessment. The primary outcomes were mortality and hospital length of stay, whereas 15 postoperative complications were included based on availability. From a main pool of comparable trials, meta-analyses were performed on trials with homogenous outcome definitions. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE). Results The main pool consisted of 76 trials with intermediate risk of bias for most outcomes. Overall, goal-directed haemodynamic therapy might reduce mortality (odds ratio=0.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 1.09) and shorten length of stay (mean difference=\textendash 0.72 days; 95\% CI, \textendash 1.10 to \textendash 0.35) but with low certainty in the evidence. For both outcomes, larger effects favouring goal-directed haemodynamic therapy were seen in abdominal surgery, very high-risk surgery, and using targets based on preload variation by the respiratory cycle. However, formal tests for subgroup differences were not statistically significant. Goal-directed haemodynamic therapy decreased risk of several postoperative outcomes, but only infectious outcomes and anastomotic leakage reached moderate certainty of evidence. Conclusions Goal-directed haemodynamic therapy during general anaesthesia might decrease mortality, hospital length of stay, and several postoperative complications.

Previous studies have shown that the FloTrac cardiac monitor may overestimate cardiac output (CO) changes following phenylephrine administration. A new algorithm (4th generation) has been developed to improve performance in this setting. We performed a prospective observational study to assess the effects of phenylephrine administration on CO values measured by the 3rd and 4th generation FloTrac algorithms. 54 patients were enrolled in this study. We used the Nexfin, a pulse contour method shown to be insensitive to vasopressor administration, as the reference method. Radial arterial pressures were recorded continuously in patients undergoing surgery. Phenylephrine administration times were documented. Arterial pressure recordings were subsequently analyzed offline using three different pulse contour analysis algorithms: FloTrac 3rd generation (G3), FloTrac 4th generation (G4), and Nexfin (nf). One minute of hemodynamic measurements was analyzed immediately before phenylephrine administration and then repeated when the mean arterial pressure peaked. A total of 157 (4.6~{$\pm~$}3.2 per patient, range 1\textendash 15) paired sets of hemodynamic recordings were analyzed. Phenylephrine induced a significant increase in stroke volume (SV) and CO with the FloTrac G3, but not with FloTrac G4 or Nexfin algorithms. Agreement between FloTrac G3 and Nexfin was: 0.23~{$\pm~$}1.19~l/min and concordance was 51.1~\%. In contrast, agreement between FloTrac G4 and Nexfin was: 0.19~{$\pm~$}0.86~l/min and concordance was 87.2~\%. In conclusion, the pulse contour method of measuring CO, as implemented in FloTrac 4th generation algorithm, has significantly improved its ability to track the changes in CO induced by phenylephrine.},

The non-invasive CO technology was considered acceptable if the pooled estimate of percentage error was {$<$}30\%, as previously recommended. Using a random-effects model, SD, pooled mean bias, and mean percentage error were calculated. An I2 statistic was also used to evaluate the inter-study heterogeneity. A total of 37 studies (1543 patients) were included. Mean CO of both methods was 4.78 litres min\`A1. Bias was presented as the reference method minus the tested methods in 15 studies. Only six studies assessed the random error (repeatability) of the tested device. The overall random-effects pooled bias (limits of agreement) and the percentage error were \`A0,13 [\`A2.38 , 2.12] litres min\`A1 and 47\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Background In critically ill patients, changes in the velocity-time integral (VTI) of the left ventricular outflow tract, measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), are often used to non-invasively assess the response to fluid administration or for performing tests assessing fluid responsiveness. However, the precision of TTE measurements has not yet been investigated in such patients. First, we aimed at assessing how many measurements should be averaged within one TTE examination to reach a sufficient precision for various variables. Second, we aimed at identifying the least significant change (LSC) of these variables between successive TTE examinations. Methods We prospectively included 100 haemodynamically stable patients in whom TTE examination was planned. Three TTE examinations were performed, the first and the third by one operator and the second by another one. We calculated the precision and LSC (1) within one examination depending on the number of averaged measurements and (2) between measurements performed in two successive examinations. Results In patients in sinus rhythm, averaging three measurements within an examination was enough for obtaining an acceptable precision (interquartile range highest value {$<$}\,10\%) for VTI. In patients with atrial fibrillation, averaging five measurements was necessary. The precision of some other common TTE variables depending on the number of measurements is provided. Between two successive examinations performed by the same operator, the LSC was 11 [5\textendash 18]\% for VTI. If two operators performed the examinations, the LSC for VTI significantly increased to 14 [8\textendash 26]\%. The LSC between two examinations for other TTE variables is also provided. Conclusions Averaging three measurements within one TTE examination is enough for obtaining precise measurements for VTI in patients in sinus rhythm but not in patients with atrial fibrillation. Between two TTE examinations performed by the same operator, the LSC of VTI is compatible with the assessment of the effects of a 500-mL fluid infusion but is not precise enough for assessing the effects of some tests predicting preload responsiveness.

Methods: Cardiac output was measured while patients underwent open gastrectomy using an ICG monitor (niccomoTM; ICG-CO); the results were compared with those measured using a FloTracTM/VigileoTM monitor (Flo-CO), which measures cardiac output by analysing the arterial waveform. Data collection commenced at the beginning of anaesthetic induction and continued until the patient was awake. Data were compared using the Bland\textendash Altman analysis, and the clinical significance of the difference between the two methods was evaluated by calculating the percentage error (\%). Results: Eleven patients were monitored during surgery. The bias of the Flo-CO and ICG-CO values was \`A0.45 l/min. The upper and lower limits of agreement were 0.96 l/min and \`A1.85 l/min, respectively. The percentage error was 28.5\%. Electrocautery induced interference that transiently impaired the performance of the ICG monitor.

The goal of this statement is to assess the scientific evidence in this field in order to provide a basis for future recommendations. Right heart catheterisation is the gold standard method to assess pulmonary haemodynamics at rest and during exercise. Exercise echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing represent non-invasive tools with evolving clinical applications. The term ``exercise pulmonary hypertension'' may be the most adequate to describe an abnormal pulmonary haemodynamic response characterised by an excessive pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) increase in relation to flow during exercise. Exercise pulmonary hypertension may be defined as the presence of resting mean PAP {$<$}25 mmHg and mean PAP {$>$}30 mmHg during exercise with total pulmonary resistance {$>$}3 Wood units. Exercise pulmonary hypertension represents the haemodynamic appearance of early pulmonary vascular disease, left heart disease, lung disease or a combination of these conditions. Exercise pulmonary hypertension is associated with the presence of a modest elevation of resting mean PAP and requires clinical follow-up, particularly if risk factors for pulmonary hypertension are present. There is a lack of robust clinical evidence on targeted medical therapy for exercise pulmonary hypertension.

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy, precision, and trending ability of the fourth-generation FloTrac/Vigileo system (version 4.00; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) by comparing cardiac output derived from FloTrac/Vigileo system (COAP) with that measured by a pulmonary artery catheter (COTD), and to determine the effects of hemodynamic variables on the bias between COTD and COAP. Design A prospective study. Setting University hospital. Participants Thirty patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Interventions Including hemodynamic variables, COTD and COAP were measured simultaneously at the following 10 time points: after the induction of anesthesia, at the start of operation, after sternotomy, before and after the administration of heparin, before and after the administration of protamine, at the start of sternal closure, at the end of operation, and on arrival to intensive care unit. Measurements and Main Results In total, 280 pairs of datasets were obtained. Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.41 L/min, a precision of 0.72 L/min, and limits of agreement of -1.85 and 1.03 L/min, with a percentage error of 37.1\%. The concordance rate determined by 4-quadrant plot analysis and the polar concordance rate were 76\% and 79\%, respectively. The linear mixed-effect model revealed that the bias was influenced strongly by the difference in pulse pressure between the radial and femoral artery (p {$<$} 0.001), and the systemic vascular resistance index (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion The fourth-generation FloTrac/Vigileo system still lacks accuracy and trending ability in cardiac surgery, and the discrepancy in cardiac output measurement depends on the peripheral vascular tone. Further improvement of this system is needed.},

  abstract = {Intravenous fluids are one of the most commonly prescribed medical therapies, with widespread effects on patient outcome, morbidity and mortality. They are often poorly understood and overseen by the most junior members of the healthcare team. Better knowledge of the appropriate choice, rate and volume of fluid, alongside the consequences of any prescription can therefore have a significant impact on patient care. This article reviews some of the basic concepts underpinning the use of fluid therapy, associated physiology, clinical application and evidence base in the perioperative setting. Suggested further reading is also provided. The approach to i.v. fluid therapy for hypovolaemia may significantly influence outcomes for patients who experience a systemic inflammatory response after sepsis, trauma, or major surgery. Currently, there is no single i.v. fluid agent that meets all the criteria for the ideal treatment for hypovolaemia. The physician must choose the best available agent(s) for each patient, and then decide when and how much to administer. Findings from large randomized trials suggest that some colloid-based fluids, particularly starch-based colloids, may be harmful in some situations, but it is unclear whether they should be withdrawn from use completely. Meanwhile, crystalloid fluids, such as saline 0.9\% and Ringer's lactate, are more frequently used, but debate continues over which preparation is preferable. Perhaps most importantly, it remains unclear how to select the optimal dose of fluid in different patients and different clinical scenarios. There is good reason to believe that both inadequate and excessive i.v. fluid administration may lead to poor outcomes, including increased risk of infection and organ dysfunction, for hypovolaemic patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on this topic and identify some key pitfalls and some areas of agreed best practice. Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors. Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews. Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain. The ultimate goal of fluid therapy is to improve the oxygenation of cells by improving the cardiac output, thus improving microcirculation by optimizing macrocirculation. This haemodynamic coherence is often altered in patients with haemorrhagic shock and sepsis. The loss of haemodynamic coherence is associated with adverse outcomes. It may be influenced by the mechanisms of the underlying disease and properties of different fluids used for resuscitation in these critically ill patients. Monitoring microcirculation and haemodynamic coherence may be an additional tool to predict the response to fluid administration. In addition, microcirculatory analysis may support the clinician in his decision to not administer fluids when microcirculatory blood flow is preserved. In future, the indication, guidance and termination of fluid therapy may be assessed by bedside microvascular analysis in combination with standard haemodynamic monitoring. Significant progress in critical care medicine has been the result of tireless observation, dedicated research, and well-timed serendipity. This article provides a historical perspective for four meaningful therapies in critical care medicine: blood transfusion, fluid resuscitation, vasopressor/inotropic support, and antibiotics. For each therapy, key discoveries and events that have shaped medical history and helped define current practice are discussed. Prominent medical and social pressures that have catalyzed research and innovation in each domain are also addressed, as well as current and future challenges.},

Methods This prospective, observational, single-centre study included 32 subjects undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia. CO was measured simultaneously with ICG and ODM before and after events likely to modify CO (vasopressor administration and volume expansion). One hundred and twenty pairs of CO measurements and 94 pairs of CO variation measurements were recorded. Results The CO variations measured by ICG correlated with those measured by ODM [r=0.88 (0.82-0.94), P{$<$}0.001]. Trending ability was good for a four-quadrant plot analysis with exclusion of the central zone ({$<$}10\%) [95\% confidence interval (CI) for concordance (0.86; 1.00)]. Moderate to good trending ability was observed with a polar plot analysis (angular bias: -7.2\textdegree; 95\% CI -12.3\textdegree; -2.5\textdegree; with radial limits of agreement -38\textdegree; 24\textdegree ). After excluding subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a Bland\textendash Altman plot showed a mean bias of 0.47 litre min-1, limits of agreements between -1.24 and 2.11 litre min-1, and a percentage error of 35\%. Conclusion ICG appears to be a reliable method for the non-invasive monitoring of CO in patients undergoing general surgery.},

Twenty-two patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery were included. CIFT and CIFick were determined simultaneously at six time-points during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. At each time-point, phenylephrine (50~\textmu g) was administered to increase systematic vascular resistance, with CI measured before and after administration (CITD used as reference method). Agreement of each method was evaluated by Bland\textendash Altman analysis, while trending ability was evaluated by four-quadrant plot analysis and polar plot analysis. By Bland\textendash Altman analysis, CIFT and CIFick showed percentage errors of 49.5\% and 78.6\%, respectively, compared with CITD. Subgroup analysis showed a percentage error between COFT and COTD of 28.9\% in patients with a CI\,{$\geq$}\,2.4~L/min/m2, and 78.1\% in patients with a CI\,{$\geq$}\,2.4~L/min/m2. The concordance rate of four-quadrant plot analysis was 93.3\% for CIFT and 66.7\% for CIFick in datasets where CITD\,{$\geq$}\,2.4~L/min/m2 before and after phenylephrine administration were included. CIFT and CIFick had wide limits of agreement with CITD, and were below acceptable limits for tracking phenylephrine-induced CI changes. However, subgroup analysis showed improved accuracy and trending ability of CIFT when only points where CITD\,{$\geq$}\,2.4~L/min/m2 were included, while there was no improvement in CIFick accuracy or trending ability.},

  abstract = {Volume infusions are one of the commonest clinical interventions in critically ill patients yet the relationship of volume to cardiac output is not well understood. Blood volume has a stressed and unstressed component but only the stressed component determines flow. It is usually about 30 \% of total volume. Stressed volume is relatively constant under steady state conditions. It creates an elastic recoil pressure that is an important factor in the generation of blood flow. The heart creates circulatory flow by lowering the right atrial pressure and allowing the recoil pressure in veins and venules to drain blood back to the heart. The heart then puts the volume back into the systemic circulation so that stroke return equals stroke volume. The heart cannot pump out more volume than comes back. Changes in cardiac output without changes in stressed volume occur because of changes in arterial and venous resistances which redistribute blood volume and change pressure gradients throughout the vasculature. Stressed volume also can be increased by decreasing vascular capacitance, which means recruiting unstressed volume into stressed volume. This is the equivalent of an auto-transfusion. It is worth noting that during exercise in normal young males, cardiac output can increase five-fold with only small changes in stressed blood volume. The mechanical characteristics of the cardiac chambers and the circulation thus ultimately determine the relationship between volume and cardiac output and are the subject of this review.},

  abstract = {Intravenous fluid administration should be considered as any other pharmacological prescription. There are three main indications: resuscitation, replacement, and maintenance. Moreover, the impact of fluid administration as drug diluent or to preserve catheter patency, i.e., fluid creep, should also be considered. As for antibiotics, intravenous fluid administration should follow the four Ds: drug, dosing, duration, de-escalation. Among crystalloids, balanced solutions limit acid\textendash base alterations and chloride load and should be preferred, as this likely prevents renal dysfunction. Among colloids, albumin, the only available natural colloid, may have beneficial effects. The last decade has seen growing interest in the potential harms related to fluid overloading. In the perioperative setting, appropriate fluid management that maintains adequate organ perfusion while limiting fluid administration should represent the standard of care. Protocols including a restrictive continuous fluid administration alongside bolus administration to achieve hemodynamic targets have been proposed. A similar approach should be considered also for critically ill patients, in whom increased endothelial permeability makes this strategy more relevant. Active de-escalation protocols may be necessary in a later phase. The R.O.S.E. conceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization, Evacuation) summarizes accurately a dynamic approach to fluid therapy, maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Even in specific categories of critically ill patients, i.e., with trauma or burns, fluid therapy should be carefully applied, considering the importance of their specific aims; maintaining peripheral oxygen delivery, while avoiding the consequences of fluid overload.},

This study aimed to test whether changes in continuous cardiac index (CCI), PPV, and stroke volume variation (SVV) after a mini-fluid challenge (100 ml of fluid during 1 min) could predict fluid responsiveness in these patients. METHODS We prospectively studied 49 critically ill, deeply sedated, and mechanically ventilated patients (tidal volume {$<$}8 ml kg(-1) of ideal body weight) without cardiac arrhythmias, in whom a fluid challenge was indicated because of circulatory failure. The CCI, SVV (PiCCO\texttrademark; Pulsion), and PPV (MP70\texttrademark; Philips) were measured before and after 100 ml of colloid infusion during 1 min, and then after the additional infusion of 400 ml during 14 min. Responders were defined as subjects with a {$\geq$}15\% increase in cardiac index (transpulmonary thermodilution) after the full (500 ml) fluid challenge. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and the grey zones were determined for changes in CCI ({$\Delta$}CCI100), SVV ({$\Delta$}SVV100), and PPV ({$\Delta$}PPV100) after 100 ml fluid challenge. RESULTS Twenty-two subjects were responders. The {$\Delta$}CCI100 predicted fluid responsiveness with an AUC of 0.78. The grey zone was large and included 67\% of subjects. The {$\Delta$}SVV100 and {$\Delta$}PPV100 predicted fluid responsiveness with AUCs of 0.91 and 0.92, respectively. Grey zones were small, including {$\leq$}12\% of subjects for both indices. CONCLUSIONS The {$\Delta$}SVV100 and {$\Delta$}PPV100 predict fluid responsiveness accurately and better than {$\Delta$}CCI100 (PiCCO\texttrademark; Pulsion) in patients with circulatory failure and ventilated with low volumes.},

  abstract = {The clinical determination of the intravascular volume can be extremely difficult in critically ill and injured patients as well as those undergoing major surgery. This is problematic because fluid loading is considered the first step in the resuscitation of hemodynamically unstable patients. Yet, multiple studies have demonstrated that only approximately 50\% of hemodynamically unstable patients in the intensive care unit and operating room respond to a fluid challenge. Whereas under-resuscitation results in inadequate organ perfusion, accumulating data suggest that over-resuscitation increases the morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients. Cardiac filling pressures, including the central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, have been traditionally used to guide fluid management. However, studies performed during the past 30 years have demonstrated that cardiac filling pressures are unable to predict fluid responsiveness. During the past decade, a number of dynamic tests of volume responsiveness have been reported. These tests dynamically monitor the change in stroke volume after a maneuver that increases or decreases venous return (preload) and challenges the patients' Frank-Starling curve. These dynamic tests use the change in stroke volume during mechanical ventilation or after a passive leg raising maneuver to assess fluid responsiveness. The stroke volume is measured continuously and in real-time by minimally invasive or noninvasive technologies, including Doppler methods, pulse contour analysis, and bioreactance.},

Aim:~         To perform an updated meta-analysis incorporating recent studies that investigated indices predictive of fluid responsiveness. A priori subgroup analysis was planned according to the location where the study was performed (ICU or operating room).         Data Sources:~         MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.         Study Selection:~         Clinical trials that reported the correlation coefficient or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the central venous pressure and change in cardiac performance following an intervention that altered cardiac preload. From 191 articles screened, 43 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult subjects, and included healthy controls (n = 1) and ICU (n = 22) and operating room (n = 20) patients.         Data Extraction:~         Data were abstracted on study characteristics, patient population, baseline central venous pressure, the correlation coefficient, and/or the AUC between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index and the percentage of fluid responders. Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the data.         Data Synthesis:~         Overall 57\% {$\pm$} 13\% of patients were fluid responders. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.54\textendash 0.58) with no heterogenicity between studies.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : A systematic review of the literature to determine the ability of dynamic changes in arterial waveform-derived variables to predict fluid responsiveness and compare these with static indices of fluid responsiveness. The assessment of a patient's intravascular volume is one of the most difficult tasks in critical care medicine. Conventional static hemodynamic variables have proven unreliable as predictors of volume responsiveness. Dynamic changes in systolic pressure, pulse pressure, and stroke volume in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation have emerged as useful techniques to assess volume responsiveness.DATA SOURCES: : MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.STUDY SELECTION: : Clinical studies that evaluated the association between stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and/or stroke volume variation and the change in stroke volume/cardiac index after a fluid or positive end-expiratory pressure challenge.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: : Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, and the correlation coefficient and/or receiver operating characteristic between the baseline systolic pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and/or pulse pressure variation and the change in stroke index/cardiac index after a fluid challenge. When reported, the receiver operating characteristic of the central venous pressure, global end-diastolic volume index, and left ventricular end-diastolic area index were also recorded. Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the data. Twenty-nine studies (which enrolled 685 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Overall, 56\% of patients responded to a fluid challenge. The pooled correlation coefficients between the baseline pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, systolic pressure variation, and the change in stroke/cardiac index were 0.78, 0.72, and 0.72, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.94, 0.84, and 0.86, respectively, compared with 0.55 for the central venous pressure, 0.56 for the global end-diastolic volume index, and 0.64 for the left ventricular end-diastolic area index. The mean threshold values were 12.5 +/- 1.6\% for the pulse pressure variation and 11.6 +/- 1.9\% for the stroke volume variation. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.89, 0.88, and 59.86 for the pulse pressure variation and 0.82, 0.86, and 27.34 for the stroke volume variation, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: : Dynamic changes of arterial waveform-derived variables during mechanical ventilation are highly accurate in predicting volume responsiveness in critically ill patients with an accuracy greater than that of traditional static indices of volume responsiveness. This technique, however, is limited to patients who receive controlled ventilation and who are not breathing spontaneously},

However inter-operator variability, and the operator characteristics which may influence that, has not been quantified. Therefore, this study aimed to assess inter-operator variability with the thermodilution technique using a mock circulation loop (MCL) with calibrated flow sensors. Participants were blinded and asked to determine 4 levels of CO using the thermodilution technique, which was compared with the MCL calibrated flow sensors. The MCL was used to randomly generate CO between 3.0 and 7.0~L/min through changes in heart rate, contractility and vascular resistance with a RHC inserted through the MCL pulmonary artery. Participant characteristics including gender, specialty, age, height, weight, body-mass index, grip strength and RHC experience were recorded and compared to determine their relationship with CO measurement accuracy. In total, there were 15 participants, made up of consultant cardiologists (6), advanced trainees in cardiology (5) and intensive care consultants (4). The majority (9) had performed 26\textendash 100 previous RHCs, while 4 had performed more than 100 RHCs. Compared to the MCL-measured CO, participants overestimated CO using the thermodilution technique with a mean difference of +0.75\,{$\pm$}\,0.71~L/min. The overall r2 value for actual vs measured CO was 0.85. The difference between MCL and thermodilution derived CO declined significantly with increasing RHC experience (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), increasing body mass index (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and decreasing grip strength (P\,=\,0.033). This study demonstrated that the thermodilution technique is a reasonable method to determine CO, and that operator experience was the only participant characteristic related to CO measurement accuracy. Our results suggest that adequate exposure to, and training in, the thermodilution technique is required for clinicians who perform RHC.},

We assessed research studies and collected data regarding study setting, patient population, fluid challenge characteristics, and monitoring. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane search engines were used. A fluid challenge was defined as an infusion of a definite quantity of fluid (expressed as a volume in mL or ml/kg) in a fixed time (expressed in minutes), whose outcome was defined as a change in predefined haemodynamic variables above a predetermined threshold. We included 124 studies, 32 (25.8\%) published in 2000\textendash 2010 and 92 (74.2\%) in 2011\textendash 2021, overall enrolling 6,086 patients, who presented sepsis/septic shock in 50.6\% of cases. The fluid challenge usually consisted of 500 mL (76.6\%) of crystalloids (56.6\%) infused with a rate of 25 mL/min. Fluid responsiveness was usually defined by a cardiac output/index (CO/CI) increase {$\geq$} 15\% (70.9\%).

  abstract = {Background: Bedside functional hemodynamic assessment has gained in popularity in the last years to overcome the limitations of static or dynamic indexes in predicting fluid responsiveness. The aim of this systematic review and metanalysis of studies is to investigate the reliability of the functional hemodynamic tests (FHTs) used to assess fluid responsiveness in adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were screened for relevant articles using a FHT, with the exception of the passive leg raising. The QUADAS-2 scale was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. In-between study heterogeneity was assessed through the I2 indicator. Bias assessment graphs were plotted, and Egger's regression analysis was used to evaluate the publication bias. The metanalysis determined the pooled area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and threshold for two FHTs: the end-expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) and the mini-fluid challenge (FC). Results: After text selection, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, 7 performed in the OR, and 14 in the ICU between 2005 and 2018. The search included 805 patients and 870 FCs with a median (IQR) of 39 (25\textendash 50) patients and 41 (30\textendash 52) FCs per study. The median fluid responsiveness was 54\% (45\textendash 59). Ten studies (47.6\%) adopted a gray zone analysis of the ROC curve, and a median (IQR) of 20\% (15\textendash 51) of the enrolled patients was included in the gray zone. The pooled area under the ROC curve for the end-expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) was 0.96 (95\%CI 0.92\textendash 1.00). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 (95\%CI 0.74\textendash 0.94) and 0.91 (95\%CI 0.85\textendash 0.95), respectively, with a best threshold of 5\% (4.0\textendash 8.0\%). The pooled area under the ROC curve for the mini-FC was 0.91 (95\%CI 0.85\textendash 0.97). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95\%CI 0.76\textendash 0.88) and 0.83 (95\%CI 0.77\textendash 0.89), respectively, with a best threshold of 5\% (3.0\textendash 7.0\%). Conclusions: The EEOT and the mini-FC reliably predict fluid responsiveness in the ICU and OR. Other FHTs have been tested insofar in heterogeneous clinical settings and, despite promising results, warrant further investigations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND~         The fluid challenge response in surgical patients can be predicted by functional haemodynamic tests. Two tests, the mini-fluid challenge (mini-FC) and end-expiratory occlusion test (EEOT), have been assessed in a few small single-centre studies with conflicting results. In general, functional haemodynamic tests have not performed reliably in predicting fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing laparotomy.         OBJECTIVE~         This trial is designed to address and compare the reliability of the EEOT and the mini-FC in predicting fluid responsiveness during laparotomy.         DESIGN~         Prospective, multicentre study.         SETTING~         Three university hospitals in Italy.         PATIENTS~         A total of 103 adults patients scheduled for elective laparotomy with invasive arterial monitoring.         INTERVENTIONS~         The study protocol evaluated the changes in the stroke volume index (SVI) 20 s (EEOT20) and 30 s (EEOT30) after an expiratory hold and after a mini-FC of 100 ml over 1 min. Fluid responsiveness required an increase in SVI at least 10\% following 4 ml kg-1 of Ringer's solution fluid challenge infused over 10 min.         MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS~         Haemodynamic data, including SVI, were obtained from pulse contour analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the tests were compared with assess fluid responsiveness.         RESULTS~         Fluid challenge administration induced an increase in SVI at least 10\% in 51.5\% of patients. The rate of fluid responsiveness was comparable among the three participant centres (P = 0.10). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (95\% CI) of the changes in SVI after mini-FC was 0.95 (0.88 to 0.98), sensitivity 98.0\% (89.5 to 99.6) and specificity 86.8\% (75.1 to 93.4) for a cut-off value of 4\% of increase in SVI. This was higher than the SVI changes after EEOT20, 0.67 (0.57 to 0.76) and after EEOT30, 0.73 (0.63 to 0.81).         CONCLUSION~         In patients undergoing laparotomy the mini-FC reliably predicted fluid responsiveness with high-sensitivity and specificity. The EEOT showed poor discriminative value and cannot be recommended for assessment of fluid responsiveness in this surgical setting.         TRIAL REGISTRATION~         NCT03808753.},

  abstract = {Since its first description in 1999 [1], many studies have demonstrated the value of pulse pressure variation (PPV) as a predictor of fluid responsiveness. These studies were pooled together in a recent meta-analysis [2] concluding that PPV predicts fluid responsiveness accurately (sensitivity 88\%, specificity 89\%), so long as limitations to its use [3,4] are understood and respected (Figure 1). The applicability of pulse pressure variation Several studies have quantified the proportion of patients in whom PPV can be used as a predictor of fluid responsiveness [5-7]. Logically, the applicability is higher in the operating theatre than in the ICU, because limitations are less often encountered [8,9]. There is currently a trend towards a reduction in tidal volume, not only in ICU patients with acute lung injury, but also in patients with healthy lungs undergoing surgery. Futier and colleagues [10] showed that a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg during surgery is associated with a better post-surgical outcome than a tidal volume of 11 ml/kg. However, nothing indicates that 6 ml/kg is better than 8 ml/kg. Actually, a recent comparison between tidal volume and outcome done on 29,343 patients who underwent general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation suggests that the ideal tidal volume is somewhere between 8 and 10 ml/kg [11]. Ultimately, the applicability of PPV depends on case mix (whether patients are mechanically ventilated, and whether they have arrhythmia), and on clinicians beliefs and practice (do they prefer ventilating their patients with 6 or 8 ml/kg?). It may easily vary from 0\% (extubated patients) to 99\% (typical open colorectal or hip fracture patient ventilated with 8 ml/kg) [8]. The zone of uncertainty, also called the grey zone Cannesson and colleagues [12], and more recently Biais and colleagues [13], have used the 'grey zone' approach to investigate the clinical value of PPV. The concept has practical value because it allows the determination of three zones: a zone where PPV predicts a positive response to fluid loading, a zone where PPV predicts a negative response , and a third zone of uncertainty or 'grey zone'. This approach should be used exclusively to assess the intrinsic predictive value of PPV, once limitations to its use have been discarded. Unfortunately, when assessing their grey zone, both Cannesson and colleagues [12] and Biais and colleagues [13] have analyzed many measurements coming from patients ventilated with a small tidal volume, or with a low heart rate/respiratory rate ratio. Because PPV does not work well in this context, their grey zones were artificially extended. In this respect, Biais and colleagues [13] showed in a subgroup analysis that the grey zone was larger in patients with a low tidal volume than in patients with a tidal volume of at least 8 ml/kg, and clearly acknowledged that 'the wide range of tidal volume can explain the importance of the grey zone and the variation of grey zone values among centers'. Both Cannesson and colleagues [12] and Biais and colleagues [13] also pooled data from studies where different techniques were used to measure cardiac output (CO). Cannesson and colleagues [12] mentioned that they 'classified responder and non-responder patients using various methods of CO measurements , all of which have unique errors of measurements and limited clinical agreement between them', suggesting that a responder with one method could have been classified as a non-responder by another method [14]. Biais and colleagues [13] acknowledged that 'the methods of CO measurements were not uniform and this may have extended the grey zone'. Therefore, from a methodological standpoint, the grey zones in both studies [12,13] were undoubtedly enlarged by these confounding factors, or shades of grey\ldots{} and readers were left in the dark with regard to the real zone of uncertainty for PPV (Figure 2).},

  abstract = {In mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure related to sepsis, we investigated whether the respiratory changes in arterial pressure could be related to the effects of volume expansion (VE) on cardiac index (CI). Forty patients instrumented with indwelling systemic and pulmonary artery catheters were studied before and after VE. Maximal and minimal values of pulse pressure (Ppmax and Ppmin) and systolic pressure (Psmax and Psmin) were determined over one respiratory cycle. The respiratory changes in pulse pressure ( {$\Delta$} Pp) were calculated as the difference between Ppmax and Ppmin divided by the mean of the two values and were expressed as a percentage. The respiratory changes in systolic pressure ( {$\Delta$} Ps) were calculated using a similar formula. The VE-induced increase in CI was {$\geqslant$} 15\% in 16 patients (responders) and {$<$} 15\% in 24 patients (nonresponders). Before VE, {$\Delta$} Pp (24 {$\pm$} 9 versus 7 {$\pm$} 3\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and {$\Delta$} Ps (15 {$\pm$} 5 versus 6 {$\pm$} 3\%, p {$<$} 0.001) were higher in responders than in nonresponders. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis showed that {$\Delta$} Pp was a more accurate indicator of fluid responsiveness than {$\Delta$} Ps. Before VE, a {$\Delta$} Pp value of 13\% allowed discrimination between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivity of 94\% and a specificity of 96\%. VE-induced changes in CI closely correlated with {$\Delta$} Pp before volume expansion (r2 = 0.85, p {$<$} 0.001).

  abstract = {Models and theories are of central importance in science, and scientists spend substantial amounts of time building, testing, comparing and revising models and theories. It is therefore not surprising that the nature of scientific models and theories has been a widely debated topic within the philosophy of science for many years. The product of two decades of research, this book provides an accessible yet critical introduction to the debates about models and theories within analytical philosophy of science since the 1920s. Roman Frigg surveys and discusses key topics and questions, including: What are theories? What are models? And how do models and theories relate to each other? The linguistic view of theories (also known as the syntactic view of theories), covering different articulations of the view, its use of models, the theory-observation divide and the theory-ladenness of observation, and the meaning of theoretical terms. The model-theoretical view of theories (also known as the semantic view of theories), covering its analysis of the model-world relationship, the internal structure of a theory, and the ontology of models. Scientific representation, discussing analogy, idealisation and different accounts of representation. Modelling in scientific practice, examining how models relate to theories and what models are, classifying different kinds of models, and investigating how robustness analysis, perspectivism, and approaches committed to uncertainty-management deal with multi-model situations. Models and Theories is the first comprehensive book-length treatment of the topic, making it essential reading for advanced undergraduates, researchers, and professional philosophers working in philosophy of science and philosophy of technology. It will also be of interest to philosophically minded readers working in physics, computer sciences and STEM fields more broadly.},

Patients:~         Patients with an acute circulatory failure who received a fluid challenge (228 patients, group 1) or in whom norepinephrine was introduced or increased (145 patients, group 2).         Interventions:~         We measured the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, and the transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output before and after the therapeutic interventions.         Main Results:~         In group 1, the fluid challenge significantly increased cardiac output by 24\% {$\pm$} 25\%. It significantly increased cardiac output by {$\geq$}15\% (+35\% {$\pm$} 27\%) in 142 patients (``responders''). The fluid-induced changes in cardiac output were correlated with the changes in pulse pressure (r = .56, p {$<$} .0001), systolic arterial pressure (r = .55, p {$<$} .0001), diastolic arterial pressure (r = .37, p {$<$} .0001), and mean arterial pressure (r = .52, p {$<$} .0001). At multivariate analysis, changes in pulse pressure were significantly related to changes in stroke volume (multiple r = .52) and to age (r = .12). A fluid-induced increase in pulse pressure of {$\geq$}17\% allowed detecting a fluid-induced increase in cardiac output of {$\geq$}15\% with a sensitivity of 65[56\textendash 72]\% and a specificity of 85[76\textendash 92]\%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the fluid-induced changes in mean arterial pressure and in diastolic arterial pressure was significantly lower than for pulse pressure. In group 2, the introduction/increase of norepinephrine significantly increased cardiac output by 14\% {$\pm$} 18\%.

Conclusions:~         Pulse pressure and systolic arterial pressure could be used for detecting the fluid-induced changes in cardiac output, in spite of a significant proportion of false-negative cases.

  abstract = {Many efforts have been made to predict, before giving fluid, whether it will increase cardiac output. Nevertheless, after fluid administration, it is also essential to assess the therapeutic efficacy and to look for possible adverse effects. Like for any drug, this step should not be missed. Basically, volume expansion is aimed at improving tissue oxygena-tion and organ function. To assess this final result, clinical signs are often unhelpful. The increase in urine output in case of acute kidney injury is a poor marker of the kidney perfusion improvement. Even if oxygen delivery has increased with fluid, the increase in oxygen consumption is not constant. Assessing this response needs to measure markers such as lactate, central/mixed venous oxygen saturation, or carbon dioxide-derived indices. If tissue oxygena-tion did not improve, one should check that cardiac output has actually increased with fluid administration. To assess this response, changes in arterial pressure are not reliable enough, and direct measurements of cardiac output are required. In cases where cardiac output did not increase with fluid, one should check that it was not due to an insuf-ficient volume of fluid administered. For this purpose, volume markers of cardiac preload sometimes lack precision. The central venous pressure, in theory at least, should not augment to a large extent in fluid responders. The worst adverse effect of fluids is the increase in the cumulative fluid balance. In patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS), the risk of aggravating pulmonary oedema should be systematically assessed by looking for increases in extravascular lung water, or, more indirectly, increases in central venous or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. In ARDS patients receiving fluid, one should always keep in mind the risk of inducing/aggravating right ventricular dilation, which should be confirmed through echocardiography. The risk of increasing the intra-abdominal pressure should be carefully sought in patients at risk. Finally, fluid-induced haemodilution should not be neglected. Like for any drug which has inconsistent effectiveness and may exert significant harm, the correct fluid management should include a cautious and comprehensive assessment of fluid-induced benefits and side effects.},

We also tested whether the changes in cardiac index induced by passive leg-raising and by an end-expiratory occlusion test were better than pulse pressure variation at predicting fluid responsiveness in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.         Design:~         Prospective study.         Setting:~         Medical intensive care unit.         Patients:~         We included 54 patients with circulatory shock (63 {$\pm$} 13 yrs; Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 63 {$\pm$} 24). Twenty-seven patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (compliance of the respiratory system, 22 {$\pm$} 3 mL/cm H2O). In nonacute respiratory distress syndrome patients, the compliance of the respiratory system was 45 {$\pm$} 9 mL/cm H2O.         Measurements and Main Results:~         We measured the response of cardiac index (transpulmonary thermodilution) to fluid administration (500 mL saline). Before fluid administration, we recorded pulse pressure variation and the changes in pulse contour analysis-derived cardiac index induced by passive leg-raising and end-expiratory occlusion. Fluid increased cardiac index {$\geq$}15\% (44\% {$\pm$} 39\%) in 30 ``responders.'' Pulse pressure variation was significantly correlated with compliance of the respiratory system (r = .58), but not with tidal volume. The higher the compliance of the respiratory system, the better the prediction of fluid responsiveness by pulse pressure variation. A compliance of the respiratory system of 30 mL/cm H2O was the best cut-off for discriminating patients regarding the ability of pulse pressure variation to predict fluid responsiveness. If compliance of the respiratory system was {$>$}30 mL/cm H2O, then the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve for predicting fluid responsiveness was not different for pulse pressure variation and the passive leg-raising and end-expiratory occlusion tests (0.98 {$\pm$} 0.03, 0.91 {$\pm$} 0.06, and 0.97 {$\pm$} 0.03, respectively). By contrast, if compliance of the respiratory system was {$\leq$}30 mL/cm H2O, then the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve was significantly lower for pulse pressure variation than for the passive leg-raising and end-expiratory occlusion tests (0.69 {$\pm$} 0.10, 0.94 {$\pm$} 0.05, and 0.93 {$\pm$} 0.05, respectively).         Conclusions:~         The ability of pulse pressure variation to predict fluid responsiveness was inversely related to compliance of the respiratory system. If compliance of the respiratory system was {$\leq$}30 mL/cm H2O, then pulse pressure variation became less accurate for predicting fluid responsiveness.

Thus, an end-expiratory occlusion may prevent the cyclic impediment in left cardiac preload and may act like a fluid challenge. We tested whether this could serve as a functional test for fluid responsiveness in patients with circulatory failure. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Thirty-four mechanically ventilated patients with shock in whom volume expansion was planned. INTERVENTION: A 15-second end-expiratory occlusion followed by a 500 mL saline infusion. MEASUREMENTS: Arterial pressure and pulse contour-derived cardiac index (PiCCOplus) at baseline, during passive leg raising (PLR), during the 5-last seconds of the end-expiratory occlusion, and after volume expansion. MAIN RESULTS: Volume expansion increased cardiac index by {$>$}15\% (2.4 +/- 1.0 to 3.3 +/- 1.2 L/min/m, p {$<$} 0.05) in 23 patients ("responders"). Before volume expansion, the end-expiratory occlusion significantly increased arterial pulse pressure by 15\% +/- 15\% and cardiac index by 12\% +/- 11\% in responders whereas arterial pulse pressure and cardiac index did not change significantly in nonresponders. Fluid responsiveness was predicted by an increase in pulse pressure {$>$}or=5\% during the end-expiratory occlusion with a sensitivity and a specificity of 87\% and 100\%, respectively, and by an increase in cardiac index {$>$}or=5\% during the end-expiratory occlusion with a sensitivity and a specificity of 91\% and 100\%, respectively. The response of pulse pressure and cardiac index to the end-expiratory occlusion predicted fluid responsiveness with an accuracy that was similar to the response of cardiac index to PLR and that was significantly better than the response of pulse pressure to PLR (receiver operating characteristic curves area 0.957 [95\% confidence interval [CI:] 0.825-0.994], 0.972 [95\% CI: 0.849-0.995], 0.937 [95\% CI: 0.797-0.990], and 0.675 [95\% CI: 0.497-0.829], respectively).

  abstract = {Although the administration of fluid is the first treatment considered in almost all cases of circulatory failure, this therapeutic option poses two essential problems: the increase in cardiac output induced by a bolus of fluid is inconstant, and the deleterious effects of fluid overload are now clearly demonstrated. This is why many tests and indices have been developed to detect preload dependence and predict fluid responsiveness. In this review, we take stock of the data published in the field over the past three years. Regarding the passive leg raising test, we detail the different stroke volume surrogates that have recently been described to measure its effects using minimally invasive and easily accessible methods. We review the limits of the test, especially in patients with intra-abdominal hypertension. Regarding the end-expiratory occlusion test, we also present recent investigations that have sought to measure its effects without an invasive measurement of cardiac output. Although the limits of interpretation of the respiratory variation of pulse pressure and of the diameter of the vena cava during mechanical ventilation are now well known, several recent studies have shown how changes in pulse pressure variation itself during other tests reflect simultaneous changes in cardiac output, allowing these tests to be carried out without its direct measurement. This is particularly the case during the tidal volume challenge, a relatively recent test whose reliability is increasingly well established. The mini-fluid challenge has the advantage of being easy to perform, but it requires direct measurement of cardiac output, like the classic fluid challenge. Initially described with echocardiography, recent studies have investigated other means of judging its effects. We highlight the problem of their precision, which is necessary to evidence small changes in cardiac output. Finally, we point out other tests that have appeared more recently, such as the Trendelenburg manoeuvre, a potentially interesting alternative for patients in the prone position.},

Therefore, method comparison studies increasingly include assessment of trending ability in the data analysis. A number of methodological challenges arise in method comparison research with respect to the application of Bland\textendash Altman and trending analysis. Failure to face these methodological challenges will lead to misinterpretation and erroneous conclusions. We therefore review the basic principles and pitfalls of Bland\textendash Altman analysis in method comparison studies concerning new CO monitors. In addition, the concept of clinical concordance is introduced to evaluate trending ability from a clinical perspective. The primary scope of this review is to provide a complete overview of the pitfalls in CO method comparison research, whereas other publications focused on a single aspect of the study design or data analysis. This leads to a stepwise approach and checklist for a complete data analysis and data representation.},

Mini-fluid challenge composed of 150 ml of albumin 5\% administered over 1 min in three consecutive 50-ml fluid boluses. An additional 350 ml was then infused at a constant rate over 15 min (for a total of 500 ml). Stroke volume (SV) was measured as the product of the subaortic velocity time integral (VTI) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in SV by {$\geq$}15\% after the infusion. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen patients were classified with Child A, 15 patients with Child B, and 21 patients with Child C cirrhosis. Thirty four patients were fluid responders and 16 patients were fluid non-responders. After 150 ml of albumin 5\%, the SV increased significantly in our cohort. The area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) was 0.7 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.5\textendash 0.8, P = 0.005). In subgroup analysis, the SV increased significantly after mini fluid challenge in the Child A group (P = 0.017) but not Child B or C groups (P = 0.3 and 0.29, respectively). The AUROC for mini-fluid challenge in the Child A group was 0.86 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.6\textendash 0.9, P = 0.0004), while mini-fluid challenge failed to discriminate between responders and nonresponders in Child B and C groups. Conclusion: A mini-fluid challenge of 150 ml albumin 5\% can predict fluid responsiveness in liver transplant patients with fair sensitivity and specifiicty. Subgroup analyis revealed that minifluid challenge can predict fluid responsiveness in patients with Child A cirrhosis but not patients with Child B or C cirrhosis. Trial registration: NCT03396159. (Prospective registered). Initial registration date was 10/01/2018.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting fluid responsiveness remains a difficult question in hemodynamically unstable patients. The author's objective was to test whether noninvasive assessment by transthoracic echocardiography of subaortic velocity time index (VTI) variation after a low volume of fluid infusion (100 ml hydroxyethyl starch) can predict fluid responsiveness. METHODS: Thirty-nine critically ill ventilated and sedated patients with acute circulatory failure were prospectively studied. Subaortic VTI was measured by transthoracic echocardiography before fluid infusion (baseline), after 100 ml hydroxyethyl starch infusion over 1 min, and after an additional infusion of 400 ml hydroxyethyl starch over 14 min. The authors measured the variation of VTI after 100 ml fluid ({$\Delta$}VTI 100) for each patient. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for ({$\Delta$}VTI 100). When available, receiver operating characteristic curves also were generated for pulse pressure variation and central venous pressure. RESULTS: After 500 ml volume expansion, VTI increased {$\geq$} 15\% in 21 patients (54\%) defined as responders. {$\Delta$}VTI 100 {$\geq$} 10\% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity and specificity of 95\% and 78\%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of {$\Delta$}VTI 100 was 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.78-0.98). In 29 patients, pulse pressure variation and central venous pressure also were available. In this subgroup of patients, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for {$\Delta$}VTI 100, pulse pressure variation, and central venous pressure were 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.74-0.98, P {$<$} 0.05), 0.55 (95\% CI: 0.35-0.73, NS), and 0.61 (95\% CI: 0.41-0.79, NS), respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with low volume mechanical ventilation and acute circulatory failure, {$\Delta$}VTI 100 accurately predicts fluid responsiveness.},

  abstract = {In liver transplantation for end-stage liver failure, monitoring of continuous cardiac output (CCO) is used for circulatory management due to hemodynamic instability. CCO is often measured using the minimally invasive FloTrac/Vigileo system (FVS-CCO), instead of a highly invasive pulmonary artery catheter (PAC-CCO). The FVS has improved accuracy due to an updated cardiac output algorithm, but the effect of this change on the accuracy of FVS-CCO in liver transplantation is unclear. In this study, we assessed agreement between fourth-generation FVS-CCO and PAC-CCO in 20 patients aged\,{$\geq$}\,20~years who underwent scheduled or emergency liver transplantation at Kyoto University Hospital from September 2019 to June 2021. Consent was obtained before surgery and data were recorded throughout the surgical period. Pearson correlation coefficient (r), Bland\textendash Altman and 4-quadrant plot analyses were performed on the extracted data. A total of 1517 PAC-CCO vs. FVS-CCO data pairs were obtained. The mean PAC-CCO was 8.73 L/min and the mean systemic vascular resistance was 617.5 dyne{$\cdot$}s{$\cdot$}cm-5, r was 0.48, bias was 1.62 L/min, the 95\% limits of agreement were\,-\,3.04 to 6.27, and the percentage error was 54.36\%. These results show that agreement and trending between fourth-generation FVS-CCO and PAC-CCO are low in adult liver transplant recipients.},

We hypothesized that with transient increase in tidal volume from 6 to 8\,mL/kg predicted body weight, that is, ``tidal volume challenge,'' the changes in pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation will predict fluid responsiveness.         Design:~         Prospective, single-arm study.         Setting:~         Medical-surgical ICU in a university hospital.         Patients:~         Adult patients with acute circulatory failure, having continuous cardiac output monitoring, and receiving controlled low tidal volume ventilation.         Interventions:~         The pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and cardiac index were recorded at tidal volume 6\,mL/kg predicted body weight and 1 minute after the ``tidal volume challenge.'' The tidal volume was reduced back to 6\,mL/kg predicted body weight, and a fluid bolus was given to identify fluid responders (increase in cardiac index {$>$} 15\%). The end-expiratory occlusion test was performed at tidal volumes 6 and 8\,mL/kg predicted body weight and after reducing tidal volume back to 6\,mL/kg predicted body weight.         Results:~         Thirty measurements were obtained in 20 patients. The absolute change in pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation after increasing tidal volume from 6 to 8\,mL/kg predicted body weight predicted fluid responsiveness with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (with 95\% CIs) being 0.99 (0.98\textendash 1.00) and 0.97 (0.92\textendash 1.00), respectively. The best cutoff values of the absolute change in pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation after increasing tidal volume from 6 to 8\,mL/kg predicted body weight were 3.5\% and 2.5\%, respectively. The pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, central venous pressure, and end-expiratory occlusion test obtained during tidal volume 6\,mL/kg predicted body weight did not predict fluid responsiveness.         Conclusions:~         The changes in pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variation obtained by transiently increasing tidal volume (tidal volume challenge) are superior to pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation in predicting fluid responsiveness during low tidal volume ventilation.},

An updated systematic review and meta-analysis were also conducted including randomized trials published from 1966 to February 2014.Patients were randomly assigned to a cardiac output\textendash guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotrope (dopexamine) infusion during and 6 hours following surgery (n=368) or to usual care (n=366).The primary outcome was a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity on day 7; infection, critical care\textendash free days, and all-cause mortality at 30 days; all-cause mortality at 180 days; and length of hospital stay.Baseline patient characteristics, clinical care, and volumes of intravenous fluid were similar between groups. Care was nonadherent to the allocated treatment for less than 10\% of patients in each group. The primary outcome occurred in 36.6\% of intervention and 43.4\% of usual care participants (relative risk [RR], 0.84 [95\% CI, 0.71-1.01]; absolute risk reduction, 6.8\% [95\% CI, -0.3\% to 13.9\%]; P\,=\,.07). There was no significant difference between groups for any secondary outcomes. Five intervention patients (1.4\%) experienced cardiovascular serious adverse events within 24 hours compared with none in the usual care group. Findings of the meta-analysis of 38 trials, including data from this study, suggest that the intervention is associated with fewer complications (intervention, 488/1548 [31.5\%] vs control, 614/1476 [41.6\%]; RR, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.71-0.83]) and a nonsignificant reduction in hospital, 28-day, or 30-day mortality (intervention, 159/3215 deaths [4.9\%] vs control, 206/3160 deaths [6.5\%]; RR, 0.82 [95\% CI, 0.67-1.01]) and mortality at longest follow-up (intervention, 267/3215 deaths [8.3\%] vs control, 327/3160 deaths [10.3\%]; RR, 0.86 [95\% CI, 0.74-1.00]).In a randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, use of a cardiac output\textendash guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm compared with usual care did not reduce a composite outcome of complications and 30-day mortality. However, inclusion of these data in an updated meta-analysis indicates that the intervention was associated with a reduction in complication rates.isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN04386758},

This analysis differs from those previously carried out in that it uses the pressure-flow relationships of a waterfall rather than those described by Poiseuille's law to characterize the flow between arterioles and capillaries in the presence of active tension. It is suggested that, under some conditions, the driving pressure for the flow through arterioles is not the difference between the inflow pressure and outflow pressure of the arterioles, but rather the difference between the inflow pressure and the critical closing pressure. This seemingly slight modification causes marked differences in the interpretation of pressure-flow relationships and vascular resistance in the presence of active tone.},

At steady state, venous return equals cardiac output, as the venous and arterial systems operate in series. However, unlike the arterial one, the venous network is a capacitive system with a high compliance. It includes a part of unstressed blood, which is a reservoir that can be recruited via sympathetic endogenous or exogenous stimulation. Guyton's model describes the three determinants of venous return: the mean systemic filling pressure, the right atrial pressure and the resistance to venous return. Recently, new methods have been developed to explore such determinants at the bedside. In this narrative review, after a reminder about Guyton's model and current methods used to investigate it, we emphasize how Guyton's physiology helps understand the effects on cardiac output of common treatments used in critically ill patients.},

In addition to such observations, Sander made original contributions in resuscitation physiology while working with Hugo Kronecker (1839\textendash 1914). With Kronecker, Sander published observations on life saving transfusions with inorganic salt solutions in dogs ``Bemerkung \"uber lebensrettende Transfusion mit anorganischer Salzl\"osung bei Hunden'' a very early work on isovolemic fluid resuscitation.

  abstract = {The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension. Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, n = 7). During HEM-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload. They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.},

  abstract = {In dogs and humans, the magnitude of the variation in systolic pressure (SPV) over the respiratory cycle during mechanical ventilation appears to be inversely related to intravascular volume.Also reported to correlate with changes in volume status is Delta down, the difference between systolic pressure at end-expiration and the lowest value during the respiratory cycle. These variables were examined during graded hemorrhage in eight anesthetized, mechanically ventilated subjects, and seven awake, spontaneously breathing subjects. SPV and Delta down were measured in sequence at baseline, after 500 mL blood removal, after 1000 mL (total) blood removal, after 500 mL hetastarch replacement, after 1000 mL (total) hetastarch replacement, and after 500 mL normal saline (NS). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test the significance of the change in SPV and Delta down among the interventions. During mechanical ventilation, each 500-mL hemorrhage significantly increased SPV and Delta down, and each 500-mL hetastarch infusion significantly decreased SPV and Delta down. After hetastarch, both SPV and Delta down were smaller than at baseline and may explain why the infusion of NS caused nonsignificant reductions in SPV and Delta down. A SPV of 5 mm Hg or less, or a Delta down of 2 mm Hg or less appeared to indicate minimal intravascular volume depletion. During spontaneous ventilation, Delta down could not be determined accurately in several subjects, and SPV did not change in the appropriate direction in all cases of hemorrhage and volume infusion. It was concluded that SPV and Delta down appear to follow shifts in intravascular volume in relatively healthy, mechanically ventilated humans under isoflurane anesthesia; however, the use of SPV during spontaneous ventilation appears problematic, perhaps due to uncontrolled tidal volumes.

BACKGROUND Healthy humans may live in a state of fluid responsiveness without the need for fluid supplementation. Goal-directed protocols driven by such measures are limited in their ability to define the optimal fluid state during surgery. METHODS This analysis of data on file included 92,094 adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery with endotracheal intubation between 2007 and 2014 at an academic tertiary care hospital and two affiliated community hospitals. The primary exposure variable was total intraoperative volume of crystalloid and colloid administered. The primary outcome was 30-day survival. Secondary outcomes were respiratory complications within three postoperative days (pulmonary edema, reintubation, pneumonia, or respiratory failure) and acute kidney injury. Exploratory outcomes were postoperative length of stay and total cost of care. Our models were adjusted for patient-, procedure-, and anesthesia-related factors. RESULTS A U-shaped association was observed between the volume of fluid administered intraoperatively and 30-day mortality, costs, and postoperative length of stay. Liberal fluid volumes (highest quintile of fluid administration practice) were significantly associated with respiratory complications whereas both liberal and restrictive (lowest quintile) volumes were significantly associated with acute kidney injury. Moderately restrictive volumes (second quintile) were consistently associated with optimal postoperative outcomes and were characterized by volumes approximately 40\% less than traditional textbook estimates: infusion rates of approximately 6-7 mL/kg/hr or 1 L of fluid for a 3-hour case. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative fluid dosing at the liberal and restrictive margins of observed practice is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, cost, and length of stay.},

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the performance of the system. Sixty-five full manuscripts on validation of CO measurements in humans, published in English, were retrieved; these included 2234 patients and 44 592 observations. Results have been analysed according to underlying patient conditions, that is, general critical illness and surgery as normodynamic conditions, cardiac and (post)cardiac surgery as hypodynamic conditions, and liver surgery and sepsis as hyperdynamic conditions, and subsequently released software versions. Eight studies compared SVV with other dynamic indices. CO, bias, precision, \%error, correlation, and concordance differed among underlying conditions, subsequent software versions, and their interactions, suggesting increasing accuracy and precision, particularly in hypo- and normodynamic conditions. The bias and the trending capacity remain dependent on (changes in) vascular tone with most recent software. The SVV only moderately agreed with other dynamic indices, although it was helpful in predicting fluid responsiveness in 85\% of studies addressing this. Since its introduction, the performance of uncalibrated FloTrac/Vigileo\texttrademark{} has improved particularly in hypo- and normodynamic conditions. A \%error at or below 30\% with most recent software allows sufficiently accurate and precise CO measurements and trending for routine clinical use in normo- and hypodynamic conditions, in the absence of large changes in vascular tone. The SVV may usefully supplement these measurements.},

  abstract = {This guideline aims to provide an overview of the present knowledge on aspects of perioperative fasting with assessment of the quality of the evidence. A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases to identify trials published between 1950 and late 2009 concerned with preoperative fasting, early resumption of oral intake and the effects of oral carbohydrate mixtures on gastric emptying and postoperative recovery. One study on preoperative fasting which had not been included in previous reviews and a further 13 studies published since the most recent review were identified. The searches also identified 20 potentially relevant studies of oral carbohydrates and 53 on early resumption of oral intake. Publications were classified in terms of their evidence level, scientific validity and clinical relevance. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network scoring system for assessing level of evidence and grade of recommendations was used. The key recommendations are that adults and children should be encouraged to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before elective surgery (including caesarean section) and all but one member of the guidelines group consider that tea or coffee with milk added (up to about one fifth of the total volume) are still clear fluids. Solid food should be prohibited for 6 h before elective surgery in adults and children, although patients should not have their operation cancelled or delayed just because they are chewing gum, sucking a boiled sweet or smoking immediately prior to induction of anaesthesia. These recommendations also apply to patients with obesity, gastro-oesophageal reflux and diabetes and pregnant women not in labour. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of antacids, metoclopramide or H2-receptor antagonists before elective surgery in non-obstetric patients, but an H2-receptor antagonist should be given before elective caesarean section, with an intravenous H2-receptor antagonist given prior to emergency caesarean section, supplemented with 30 ml of 0.3 mol l-1 sodium citrate if general anaesthesia is planned. Infants should be fed before elective surgery. Breast milk is safe up to 4 h and other milks up to 6 h. Thereafter, clear fluids should be given as in adults. The guidelines also consider the safety and possible benefits of preoperative carbohydrates and offer advice on the postoperative resumption of oral intake.},

  abstract = {To test hypotheses regarding relations between meaningful parameters, it is often necessary to calculate these parameters from other directly measured variables. For example, the relationship between O2 consumption and O2 delivery may be of interest, although these may be computed from measurements of cardiac output and blood O2 contents. If a measured variable is used in the calculation of two derived parameters, error in the measurement will couple the calculated parameters and introduce a bias, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. This paper presents a method of correcting for this bias in the linear regression coefficient and the Pearson correlation coefficient when calculations involve the nonlinear and linear combination of the measured variables. The general solution is obtained when the first two terms of a Taylor series expansion of the function can be used to represent the function, as in the case of multiplication. A significance test for the hypothesis that the regression coefficient is equal to zero is also presented. Physiological examples are provided demonstrating this technique, and the correction methods are also applied in simulations to verify the adequacy of the technique and to test for the magnitude of the coupling effect. In two previous studies of O2 consumption and delivery, the effect of coupled error is shown to be small when the range of O2 deliveries studied is large, and measurement errors are of reasonable size.},

Design Prospective study. Setting University Hospital. Participants Twenty-three patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Interventions Phenylephrine (100 \textmu g) was administered. Measurements and Main Results Hemodynamic variables, including COREF and COFVS, were measured before and after phenylephrine administration. Bland\textendash Altman analysis was used to assess the discrepancy between COREF and COFVS. Four-quadrant plot and polar-plot analyses were utilized to evaluate the trending ability of COFVS against COREF after phenylephrine boluses. One hundred thirty-six hemodynamic interventions were performed. The bias shown by the Bland\textendash Altman analysis was-0.66 L/min, and the percentage error was 55.4\%. The bias was significantly correlated with the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) before phenylephrine administration (p{$<$}0.001, r2 = 0.420). The concordance rate determined by four-quadrant plot analysis and the angular concordance rate calculated using polar-plot analysis were 87.0\% and 83.0\%, respectively. Additionally, this trending ability was not affected by SVRI state. Conclusions The trending ability of the new fourth-generation FloTracTM/VigileoTM system after increased vasomotor tone was greatly improved compared with previous versions; however, the discrepancy of the new system in CO measurement was not clinically acceptable, as in previous versions. For clinical application in critically ill patients, this vasomotor tone-dependent disagreement must be decreased.},

This prospective study tested the correlation of the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, the left ventricular end-diastolic area index measured by transesophageal echocardiography, the arterial systolic pressure variation (the difference between maximal and minimal systolic blood pressure values during one mechanical breath), and its delta down (dDown) component (= apneic - minimum systolic blood pressure) with the response of cardiac output to volume expansion during sepsis.Preload parameters were measured at baseline and during graded volume expansion (increments of 500 ml) in 15 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension who required mechanical ventilation. Each volume-loading step (VLS) was classified as a responder (increase in stroke volume index \&gt; or = 15\%) or a nonresponder. Successive VLSs were performed until a nonresponder VLS was obtained.Thirty-five VLSs (21 responders) were performed. Fluid loading caused an overall significant increase in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and end-diastolic area index, and a significant decrease in systolic pressure variation and delta down (P \&lt; 0.01). There was a significant difference between responder and nonresponder VLSs in end-diastolic area index, systolic pressure variation, and dDown, but not in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Receiver-operator curve analysis showed that dDown was a more accurate indicator of the response of stroke volume index to volume loading than end-diastolic area index and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. A dDown component of more than 5 mmHg indicated that the stroke volume index would increase in response to a subsequent fluid challenge (positive and negative predictive values: 95\% and 93\%, respectively).The dDown component of the systolic pressure variation is a sensitive indicator of the response of cardiac output to volume infusion in patient with sepsis-induced hypotension who require mechanical ventilation.},

  abstract = {Fluid administration leads to a significant increase in cardiac output in only half of the intensive care unit patients. This led to the concept of assessing fluid responsiveness before infusing fluid. Pulse pressure variation, which quantifies the changes in arterial pulse pressure during mechanical ventilation, is one of the dynamic variables which can predict fluid responsiveness. The underlying hypothesis is that large respiratory changes in left ventricular stroke volume, and thus pulse pressure, occur in cases of biventricular preload responsiveness. Several studies showed that pulse pressure variation accurately predicts fluid responsiveness when patients are under controlled mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, in many conditions encountered in the intensive care unit, the interpretation of pulse pressure variation is unreliable (spontaneous breathing, cardiac arrhythmias) or doubtful (low tidal volume). To overcome some of these limitations, it has been proposed to evaluate the dynamic response of pulse pressure variation using simple tests such as the tidal volume challenge. The applicability of pulse pressure variation is higher in the operating room setting, where fluid strategies based on pulse pressure variation improve postoperative outcomes. In medical critically ill patients, though no randomized controlled trial has compared a pulse pressure variation-based fluid management with standard care, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend using fluid responsiveness indices, including pulse pressure variation, whenever applicable. In conclusion, pulse pressure variation is useful to manage fluid therapy, in specific conditions where it is reliable. The kinetics of pulse pressure variation during diagnostic or therapeutic tests also is helpful for fluid management.},

  abstract = {In longitudinal data, it is common to create `change scores' by subtracting measurements taken at baseline from those taken at follow-up, and then to analyse the resulting `change' as the outcome variable. In observational data, this approach can produce misleading causal-effect estimates. The present article uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simple simulations to provide an accessible explanation for why change scores do not estimate causal effects in observational data.Data were simulated to match three general scenarios in which the outcome variable at baseline was a (i) `competing exposure' (i.e. a cause of the outcome that is neither caused by nor causes the exposure), (ii) confounder or (iii) mediator for the total causal effect of the exposure variable at baseline on the outcome variable at follow-up. Regression coefficients were compared between change-score analyses and the appropriate estimator(s) for the total and/or direct causal effect(s).Change-score analyses do not provide meaningful causal-effect estimates unless the baseline outcome variable is a `competing exposure' for the effect of the exposure on the outcome at follow-up. Where the baseline outcome is a confounder or mediator, change-score analyses evaluate obscure estimands, which may diverge substantially in magnitude and direction from the total and direct causal effects.Future observational studies that seek causal-effect estimates should avoid analysing change scores and adopt alternative analytical strategies.},

  abstract = {Background Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. Methods Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28. Results The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [{$\pm$}SD], 12{$\pm$}11 vs. 10{$\pm$}11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2{$\pm$}0.8 and 11.8{$\pm$}0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P{$<$}0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25{$\pm$}6 and 33{$\pm$}8 cm of water (P{$<$}0.001), respectively. Conclusions In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.

  abstract = {Objectives. Previous periodontal literature has shown that there is a strong relationship between treatment effects, such as guided tissue regeneration (GTR), and baseline disease severity. However, relating change to baseline values using correlation or regression is methodologically flawed due to mathematical coupling, where the statistical procedure of testing the null hypothesis\textemdash that the coefficient of correlation or slope of regression is equal to zero\textemdash becomes erroneous. The aim of this study is to investigate if baseline disease severity is genuinely associated with the treatment outcome of intrabony defects using GTR after adjustment for mathematical coupling. In particular, we seek to demonstrate the potential effect that mathematical coupling has in distorting the results from the statistical analyses of trials of dental treatment, using data from the periodontal literature on GTR. The erroneous results arising from the use of simple correlation and regression techniques to analyse this association will be demonstrated, also the methodological flaw where the statistical procedure tests the null hypothesis\textemdash that the coefficient of correlation or the slope of regression is equal to zero. Methods. Three main periodontal journals were electronically and manually searched to extract the data for the clinical outcomes of pocket probing depth (PPD) and lifetime cumulative attachment loss (LCAL) in the studies using GTR. The relationship between clinical outcomes and baseline measurements were reanalysed using Oldham's method and the variance ratio test. Results. The results of these analyses were compared with those from the papers where the authors used the standard approach of correlation or regression. This shows that mathematical coupling caused spurious correlations between baseline disease severity and treatment effect. Ten out of 12 studies for PPD and nine out of 14 for LCAL initially claimed a significant positive relationship; after using either of the more appropriate statistical methods of adjustment, only three correlations in each group of studies remained significant. Conclusions: Previous evidence suggesting an association between baseline disease severity and treatment effect for GTR is challenged and therefore needs to be critically reviewed. All future clinical research should avoid using mathematically coupled data in correlation or regression analysis. In seeking to examine the bivariate association between baseline and subsequent change, Oldham's method is recommended.},

However, statisticians have repeatedly warned against correlating/regressing change with baseline due to two methodological concerns known as mathematical coupling and regression to the mean. Oldham's method and Blomqvist's formula are the two most often adopted methods to rectify these problems. The aims of this article are to review briefly the proposed solutions in the statistical and psychological literature, and to clarify the popular misconception that Blomqvist's formula is superior to Oldham's method. We argue that this misconception is due to a failure to recognize that the heterogeneity of individual responses to treatment is a source of regression to the mean in the analysis of the relation between change and initial value. Furthermore, we demonstrate how each method actually answers different research questions, and how confusion arises when this is not always understood.

Design Prospective study. Setting A cardiovascular-thoracic surgery ICU in a community university-affiliated hospital. Patients Post-coronary artery bypass graft patients (n = 53) in whom 210 pairs of CO measurements were made. Interventions None. Measurements and main results The CO-ICG was determined simultaneously while the nurse was performing the CO-TD. Variability within the monitoring method was better for CO-ICG compared to CO-TD (6.3\% vs 24.7\%, respectively). The correlation, bias, and precision of the CO-ICG was good compared to CO-TD (r2 = 0.658; r = 0.811; bias, -0.17 L/min; precision, 1.09 L/min; CO-ICG = 1.00 \texttimes{} CO-TD - 0.17; p {$<$} 0.001). A steady improvement in agreement of the previous ICG methodologies compared to CO-TD was observed as follows: (1) CO-K: r2 = 0.309; r = 0.556; bias, -1.71 L/min; precision, 1.81 L/min; CO-K = 0.78 \texttimes{} CO-TD - 0.45; p {$<$} 0.001; (2) CO-S: r2 = 0.361; r = 0.601; bias, -1.46 L/min; precision, 1.63 L/min; CO-S = 0.80 \texttimes{} CO-TD - 0.36; p {$<$} 0.001; and (3) CO-SB: r2 = 0.469; r = 0.685; bias, -0.77 L/min; precision, 1.69 L/min; CO-SB = 1.03 \texttimes{} CO-TD - 0.95; p {$<$} 0.001. The CO-ICG demonstrated the closest agreement to CO-TD. Conclusion The latest ICG technology for determining CO (CO-ICG) is less variable and more reproducible in an intrapatient sense than is CO-TD, it is equivalent to the average accepted CO-TD in post-coronary artery bypass graft patients, and showed marked improvement in agreement with CO-TD compared to measurements made using previous generation ICG CO equations.},

DESIGN: Prospective study with 1-year follow-up. SETTING: Tertiary referral center and university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: 7 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites had metabolic studies done while receiving a 22 mmol/d sodium, 1 L/d fluid diet. INTERVENTION: TIPS insertion. MEASUREMENTS: Urinary sodium excretion, systemic and renal hemodynamics, hormonal profile, and central blood volume were measured before, at day 1 after, and at 1 month after TIPS insertion. RESULTS: Immediately after TIPS insertion, mean corrected sinusoid pressure decreased from 18.2 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 7.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P {$<$} 0.001); mean cardiac output increased from 6.83 +/- 0.68 L/min to 8.62 L/min (P = 0.005); and mean systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1018 +/- 103 dyne.s.cm-5 to 762 +/- 46 dyne.s.cm-5 (P = 0.011). Mean plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone levels, and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (5.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/d before TIPS insertion compared with 6.0 +/- 1.8 mmol/d 1 day after insertion) were unchanged; mean elevated plasma norepinephrine levels significantly increased. By 1 month after insertion, mean proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium had decreased, and this had led to a mean natriuresis of 15.1 +/- 3.1 mmol/d (P = 0.02 compared with baseline), which was associated with a decrease in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels to within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that natriuresis associated with TIPS is delayed and occurs in the presence of increased systemic vasodilatation at 1 month after insertion and that TIPS insertion should not be done in any patients with refractory ascites without careful attention to cardiac and renal status. However, in carefully selected patients, TIPS is a safe and effective means of managing refractory ascites.},

  abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML-or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The accurate assessment of intravascular volume status for the therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock is difficult and critical to critically ill patients. Non-invasive evaluation of fluid responsiveness by the rapid infusion of a very limited amount of volume is an important clinical goal. This study aimed to test whether echocardiographic parameters could predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients following a low-volume (50-ml crystalloid solution) infusion over 10 seconds. Methods: We prospectively studied 55 mechanically ventilated patients. Echocardiography was performed during a 50-ml infusion of crystalloid solution over 10 seconds and a further 450 ml over 15 minutes. Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), aortic velocity time index (VTI), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were recorded. Patients were classified as responders (Rs) if CO increased by at least 15\% following the 500-ml volume expansion or were classified as non-responders (NRs) if CO increased by less than 15\%. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) compared CO variations after 50 ml over 10 seconds ({$\Delta$}CO50) and 500 ml over 15 minutes ({$\Delta$}CO500) and the variation of VTI after infusion of 50 ml of fluid over 10 seconds ({$\Delta$}VTI50). Results: In total, 50 patients were enrolled, and 27 (54\%) of them were Rs. General characteristics, LVEF, heart rate, and central venous pressure were similar between Rs and NRs. In the Rs group, the AUC for {$\Delta$}CO50 was 0.95 {$\pm$} 0.03 (P {$<$}0.01; best cutoff value, 6\%; sensitivity, 93\%; specificity, 91\%). Moreover, {$\Delta$}CO50 and {$\Delta$}CO500 were strongly correlated (r = 0.87; P {$<$}0.01). The AUC for {$\Delta$}VTI50 was 0.91 {$\pm$} 0.04 (P {$<$}0.01; best cutoff value, 9\%; sensitivity, 74\%; specificity, 95\%). {$\Delta$}VTI50 and {$\Delta$}CO500 were positively correlated (r = 0.72; P {$<$}0.01). Conclusion: In critically ill patients, the variation of CO and VTI after the administration of 50-ml crystalloid solution over 10 seconds ({$\Delta$}CO50 and {$\Delta$}VTI50) can accurately predict fluid responsiveness.

  abstract = {Background Traditional formulas to calculate pulse pressure variation (PPV) cannot be used in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We have developed a new algorithm that accounts for arrhythmia-induced pulse pressure changes, allowing us to isolate and quantify ventilation-induced pulse pressure variation (VPPV). The robustness of the algorithm was tested in patients subjected to altered loading conditions. We investigated whether changes in VPPV imposed by passive leg raising (PLR) were proportional to the pre-PLR values. Methods Consenting patients with active AF scheduled for an ablation of the pulmonary vein under general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation were included. Loading conditions were altered by PLR. ECG and invasive pressure data were acquired during 60 s periods before and after PLR. A generalised additive model was constructed for each patient on each observation period. The impact of AF was modelled on the two preceding RR intervals of each beat (RR0 and RR\textendash 1). The impact of ventilation and the long-term pulse pressure trends were modelled as separate splines. Ventilation-induced pulse pressure variation was defined as the percentage of the maximal change in pulse pressure during the ventilation cycle. Results Nine patients were studied. The predictive abilities of the models had a median r2 of 0.92 (inter-quartile range: 89.2\textendash 94.2). Pre-PLR VPPV ranged from 0.1\% to 27.9\%. After PLR, VPPV decreased to 0\textendash 11.3\% (P{$<$}0.014). The relation between the Pre-PLR values and the magnitude of the changes imposed by the PLR was statistically significant (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Our algorithm enables quantification of VPPV in patients with AF with the ability to detect changing loading conditions.},

Methods: Patients experiencing septic shock and who were on mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit were divided into responder and nonresponder groups according to whether their cardiac index increased by more than 10\% after the FC. Before and after those tests, the changes in ETCO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$}, central venous pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, and cardiac output were recorded. Results: Of the 48 patients in the study, 34 had fluid responsiveness according to the changes in cardiac output or stroke volume. The {$\delta$}CI and {$\delta$}ETCO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} in the responder group were larger than the changes in the nonresponder group during the PLR test (1.1 {$\pm$} 0.7 vs 0.2 {$\pm$} 0.4 L/min per square meter, 3.0 {$\pm$} 3.0 vs 0.5 {$\pm$} 2.5 mm Hg; P {$<$} .05) but not during mini-FC. {$\delta$}ETCO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} greater than or equal to 5\% during the PLR test predicted fluid responsiveness with 93.4\% specificity and 75.8\% sensitivity in a receiver operating characteristic curve. The area under the curve was 0.849 (95\% confidence interval, 0.739-0.930). {$\delta$}ETCO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} greater than or equal to 3\% during the mini-FC predicted fluid responsiveness with 93.4\% specificity and 33.3\% sensitivity in a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve was 0.781 (95\% confidence interval, 0.646-0.915). Conclusions: The changes in ETCO{$<$}inf{$>$}2{$<$}/inf{$>$} may predict fluid responsiveness during the PLR test in patients with septic shock, but similar results were not found with the mini-FC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prediction accuracy of pulse pressure variation (PPV) for fluid responsiveness was proposed to be unreliable in low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation. It was suggested that changes in PPV obtained by transiently increasing Vt~to 8~ml/kg accurately predicted fluid responsiveness even in subjects receiving low Vt. We assessed whether the changes in PPV induced by a Vt~challenge predicted fluid responsiveness in our critically ill subjects ventilated with low Vt 6~ml/kg. METHODS: This study is a prospective single-center study. PPV and other parameters were measured at a Vt~of 6~mL/kg, 8~mL/kg, and after volume expansion. The prediction accuracy~of~PPV and other parameters for~fluid~responsiveness before and after tidal volume challenge was also analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the 76 subjects enrolled in the study were responders (41\%). Respiratory~system~compliance of all subjects decreased significantly (26\,{$\pm$}\,4.3). The PPV values were significantly higher in the responder group than the non-responder group before (8.8\,{$\pm$}\,2.7 vs 6.8\,{$\pm$}\,3.1) or after (13.0\,{$\pm$}\,1.7 vs 8.5\,{$\pm$}\,3.0) Vt challenge. In the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, PPV6 showed unsatisfactory predictive capability with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95\%CI, 0.57-0.79, p\,=\,0.002) at a Vt~of 6~mL/kg. PPV8 and{$\Delta$}PPV6-8 showed good predictive capability with an AUC of 0.90 (95\% CI, 0.81-0.96, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and 0.90 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.95,~P\,{$<$}\,0.001) respectively. The corresponding cutoff values were 11\% for PPV8 and 2\% for {$\Delta$}PPV6-8. CONCLUSIONS: PPV shows a poor operative performance as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in critically ill subjects ventilated with a tidal volume of 6~mL/\,kg. Vt challenge could improve the predictive~accuracy of PPV to a good but not excellent extent when respiratory~system~compliance decreased significantly.},
