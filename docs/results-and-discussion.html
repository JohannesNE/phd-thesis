<p>We identify two problems in most MFC studies: First, the predictor (MFC) is included in the outcome (the response to the full fluid challenge). And, second, a shared measurement error between the predictor and outcome will cause a spurious correlation. Both effects lead to an overestimation of the predictive performance of the MFC.</p>
<p>In the reanalysis of data from the study by Muller et al., 2011 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Muller2011" role="doc-biblioref">43</a>]</span>, we found that the MFC predicted a response to the full fluid challenge (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta SV_{500} &gt; 15 \%\)</span>) with an AUROC of 0.92, 95%CI [0.83; 1.00] (as reported in the original study), while prediction of the response to the remaining fluid (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta SV_{400} &gt; 15 \%\)</span>) had an AUROC of 0.33 95% CI [0.11; 0.55]—i.e., worse than flipping a coin. While neither of these reflect the true predictive ability of the MFC, this analysis illustrates the importance of this design choice (see Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-muller-plot">4.1</a>).</p>

<p>The MFC study design used by Guinot et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-guinotMinifluidChallengePredicts2015" role="doc-biblioref">97</a>]</span> avoids including the predictor in the outcome by only predicting the response to the remaining 400 ml fluid, and it avoids the spurious correlation by adding a new baseline SV-measurement before administering the remaining 400 ml fluid. Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-mfc-null-sim-better">4.2</a> illustrates how this design does not cause a spurious correlation between predictor and outcome.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The design with a new baseline measurement is still not without problems. Essentially, we want to use the MFC response to predict whether a patient will benefit from being given the remaining fluid bolus.
However, since all patients receive both fluid boluses, we simply do not know what would happen if the remaining fluid was withheld. The implicit assumption in studies with the problematic design (predicting the full response, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta SV_{500}\)</span>) is that SV would return to the baseline level if the remaining fluid was withheld, since this is the level that the final SV measurement is compared against. In the design with a new baseline measurement (used by Guinot et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-guinotMinifluidChallengePredicts2015" role="doc-biblioref">97</a>]</span>), the implicit assumption is that SV would remain at the level of the new baseline (<span class="math inline">\(SV_{100}b\)</span> in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-mfc-null-sim-better">4.2</a>) if no further fluid challenge was given. But this may not be the case. Imagine that a subject responds to the MFC and retains this new and higher SV after receiving the remaining fluid. This subject would be classified as a non-responder (no benefit), but it could be that in a counterfactual situation, where only the MFC was given, the subject would drop in SV. In that hypothetical situation, the subject may actually have benefitted from the remaining fluid, without directly <em>responding</em> to it. By using the design by Guinot et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-guinotMinifluidChallengePredicts2015" role="doc-biblioref">97</a>]</span>, we overcome an important statistical problem, but we risk classifying subjects as non-responders, who may have benefited from the remaining fluid challenge. This limitation can be reduced by waiting, e.g., 10 minutes between finishing the MFC and starting the infusion of the remaining fluid. By that time, any large but transient response to the MFC has likely subsided.</p>

</h2>
<p>A main aim with Paper 2 was to introduce the reader to GAMs in a practical manner. The examples in the paper have some intriguing clinical use cases, but we did not attempt to prove any benefit over existing methods. We demonstrated that the information in steady-state recordings of PP and CVP can effectively be represented in a GAM, and that from these fitted models, we can draw physiological inferences that are not directly available in the raw time series or waveform.</p>

</h3>
<p>PPV-estimation during low heart-rate-to-respiratory-rate (HR/RR) ventilation is an intriguing example of how a GAM can reveal hidden information. When HR/RR &lt; 3.6, the <em>classical</em> method for PPV estimation is believed to be unreliable <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Backer2009" role="doc-biblioref">57</a>]</span>. In Paper 2, we fit a GAM to a time series of PP recorded while the patient is ventilated with a HR/RR of 2.17—i.e., there are just above two beats per respiratory cycle. When the PP time series is plotted, it seems like PPV is changing (see Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-GAM-PP-high-rr">4.3</a>a). However, the cyclic effect of ventilation (Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-GAM-PP-high-rr">4.3</a>b) explains nearly all the variation in PP. From this smooth relationship between a beat’s position in the respiratory cycle and the PP created, we can calculate PPV.</p>

</h3>
<p>The second example in Paper 2 demonstrates how a GAM with just four relatively simple components can represent most of the variation in a steady-state CVP waveform. We recorded a CVP waveform before and after administration of a 250 ml fluid bolus (two short samples of the observed data are presented in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-raw-CVP-fluid">4.4</a>). It is clear that the CVP waveform changes with the fluid administration, but it is not easy to precisely describe this change.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>By fitting a GAM to the recorded CVP waveform, we can make inferences and visualisations that are not readily available in the raw data. A relatively simple example is the visualisation of how the shape of the CVP waveform changes with the administration of fluid, and how the effect of ventilation on the CVP waveform differs before and after fluid: Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-GAM-CVP-fluid">4.5</a>a shows the GAM-fit of the CVP through a cardiac cycle at end inspiration and end expiration, both before and after fluid. These curves do not directly exist in the observed waveforms; both because they represent the average cardiac cycle, and because the effect of ventilation is fixed to either end expiration or end inspiration (in the observed waveform, the position in both the cardiac and respiratory cycle change continuously).</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The GAM is only fitted to a single subject’s CVP, so the conclusions apply only to this single fluid administration in this subject. Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-GAM-CVP-fluid">4.5</a>a shows that after the fluid bolus, the variation in CVP over a cardiac cycle increased. Conversely, the variation over a respiratory cycle decreased (this is especially clear in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-GAM-CVP-fluid">4.5</a>b). The height of the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> wave (corresponding to the atrial contraction) was highest after fluid, and this height was less variable after fluid. For the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> wave (the right atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens), the interaction between the cardiac and respiratory cycle changed with fluid: the shape of the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> wave before and after fluid was similar at end inspiration; but at end expiration, the peak of the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> wave was later and higher, possibly representing ongoing venous return filling the right atrium.</p>
<p>Many hypotheses regarding the shape of a waveform could be investigated and formally tested from GAMs similar to this. For example, it has been proposed that the depth and slope of the <span class="math inline">\(x'\)</span> descend is related to the strength of the right ventricular contraction (similarly to the ultrasonic measure, <em>tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion</em> (TAPSE)) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-rautDescentCVPIndirect2014" role="doc-biblioref">98</a>]</span>. If this is the case, the respiratory variation in the <span class="math inline">\(x'\)</span> descend may represent the right ventricular response to changes in afterload, and a variable <span class="math inline">\(x'\)</span> descend could imply that increases in airway pressure (through <em>positive end expiratory pressure</em> (PEEP) or high <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>) should be avoided. The respiratory variation in the <span class="math inline">\(x'\)</span> descend is captured in the cardio-respiratory interaction term (illustrated in Figure <a href="methods.html#fig:method-gam-CVP">3.9</a>d, approx. 0.4 seconds after the P wave).</p>

<p>Paper 3 covers a clinical study of 52 subjects undergoing open abdominal surgery. Of these, 50 received a 250 ml fluid bolus. We had three overall aims for the study: First, we investigated the accuracy of fluid responsiveness prediction for PPV measured at different ventilator settings. Second, we compared a classic method for deriving PPV (<span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span>) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-michardClinicalUseRespiratory1999" role="doc-biblioref">53</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Backer2009" role="doc-biblioref">57</a>]</span> to the GAM derived PPV presented in Paper 2 (<span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span>). Third, we investigated the effect of <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span> and RR on PPV (<em>Classic</em> and <em>GAM-derived</em>).</p>

<p>The fluid responses observed in this study were unfortunately very small. Only ten subjects had an increase in SV &gt; 10%, prespecified as a significant fluid response. The low number of responders made the estimates of AUROC imprecise. For example, the AUROC for <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> at RR=10 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> was 0.73 95%CI [0.57; 0.90]. I.e., the data is compatible with both poor and excellent fluid responsiveness prediction. Generally, the point estimate for AUROC fell with higher RR and lower <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>. The results were similar for <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span>. All ROC analyses are shown in <a href="paper-3.html#paper3-suppl">Paper 3 - Supplementary 3</a> Fig. S1.</p>

<p>We used Bland-Altman plots to compare <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> for each ventilator setting. The comparison for RR=10 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> showed good agreement between the methods, though three subjects had a <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> that was three to five %-points higher than their <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> (see Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-PPV-gam-vs-classic-1010">4.6</a>).

<p>With 52 subjects and ten ventilator settings for each, we had 520 potential windows for PPV analysis. Of these, 507 were eligible for analysis. Exclusions were due to either ≥3 extrasystoles within a window (n=7) or because the setting with RR=31 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=8 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> was omitted when the airway pressure was expected to exceed 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (n=4). For all eligible windows, both <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> were calculated (see Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-ppv-observed">4.8</a>).</p>

<p>Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-mix-mod-est">4.9</a> shows the posterior estimates for the Bayesian mixed model fitted to all 1014 PPV estimates. We see that PPV is nearly proportional to <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span> for both <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span>. A direct proportionality implies that PPV at <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=4 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> would be 40% of PPV at <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>, but we see in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-mix-mod-est">4.9</a>b that the expected PPV is slightly higher (approx. 50%).</p>
<p>The effect of RR differs markedly between the two PPV methods: at RR=31 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> is reduced by approx. 20% while <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> is reduced by more than 40% relative to at RR=10 min<sup>-1</sup>. This difference matches what we see in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-heart-rate-resp-rate">4.7</a>—at high RR, <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> is generally higher than <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span>.</p>

<p>A probable explanation for the strong effect of RR on <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> is, that with high RR, we often have low HR/RR. This creates a sampling problem as visualised in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:results-GAM-PP-high-rr">4.3</a>, where <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{Classic}\)</span> will underestimate the “true” PPV, since only some respiratory cycles will have beats occurring at the maximum and minimum effect of ventilation; simply because there are few beats per cycle. The fall in <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> with increasing RR may reflect a true physiologic effect of RR on PPV. It could also reflect a physiologic effect of HR/RR is present, though smaller than originally suggested by De Backer et al., 2009 <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Backer2009" role="doc-biblioref">57</a>]</span>. From this study, we cannot determine if the effect on <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> is from RR directly or from HR/RR.</p>
<p>We can use the results from this model to account for ventilator settings when interpreting PPV. The optimal PPV threshold for predicting a response to fluid seems to be around 12% at <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup><span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-marikDynamicChangesArterial2009" role="doc-biblioref">55</a>]</span>; with this <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>, RR will usually be around 10 min<sup>-1</sup>. Instead of running studies to investigate the optimal threshold for all combinations of RR and <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>, we can use the results from our model to calculate a <em>best guess</em> for what PPV would be, if the ventilator settings were changed to RR=10 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>. As an example, if a patient is ventilated with RR=24 min<sup>-1</sup> and <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=6 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>, and we measure a PPV of 8% using the GAM method, we can calculate a <em>best guess</em> for PPV at RR=10 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> with the following formula:
<span class="math display">\[
PPV_{RR=10,V_T=10} = 8 \% \cdot \frac{1}{0.64} \cdot \frac{1}{0.87} \approx 14 \% ,
\]</span>
where 0.64 is the model estimate for the relative effect of ventilation with <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=6 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.87 is the relative effect of RR=24 min<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>For practical use, we can simplify the formula for correcting <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> by simply assuming a direct proportionality between <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>. The reason this approximation works is, that while <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> does not change in exact proportion to <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>, an increase in <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span> is usually accompanied with lowering RR to ensure normoventilation. Lowering RR happens to increase <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> by the amount needed to make <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> change in proportion to the change in <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>. For example, a patient, who is normoventilated at RR=10 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=10 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>, is also approximately normoventilated at RR=31 min<sup>-1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>=4 ml kg<sup>-1</sup>. The effects on <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> of these changes are 81% for the RR change and 50% for the <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span> change. Therefore, the combined effect of the change in ventilator settings is <span class="math inline">\(81 \% \cdot 50 \% = 40.5 \%\)</span>, corresponding to a <span class="math inline">\(PPV_{GAM}\)</span> change in proportion to the <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span> change.</p>

<p>We included patients in a period where the treating anesthesiologist expected that no hemodynamic intervention was needed in the next 15 minutes, to ensure that we could complete the study protocol. This may explain the low number of fluid responders and the correspondingly low PPV values. We do not know whether the reported effects of ventilator settings on PPV can be generalised to a more fluid responsive population with higher PPV values.</p>
<p>Ventilation with high RR (e.g. 31 min<sup>-1</sup>) is rarely used for surgical anaesthesia. It is unknown whether the results for the present intraoperative patient population apply to e.g. the setting of ARDS, where high RR is used, but where lung mechanics can be markedly affected by the underlying condition.</p>
<p>While our results provide a strong indication that the low HR/RR limitation may be overcome with the GAM method, the generally poor predictive performance of PPV in this study made a direct investigation of this impossible. It is plausible that the GAM method accurately measures PPV at low HR/RR, but this PPV is physiologically different from PPV at high HR/RR and does not reflect fluid responsiveness.</p>
