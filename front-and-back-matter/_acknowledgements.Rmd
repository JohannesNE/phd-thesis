Thanks to my supervisor, Simon Tilma Vistisen, colleagues, family and friends, as well as Aarhus University and Holger & Ruth Hesse's mindefond for founding this work. 

Also, thanks to all the kind strangers on the internet who selflessly helped me with various statistical and technical issues. Special thanks to John George Karippacheril, developer of [VSCapture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3788264/), who helped me customize his software to work with department ventilators; essential for acquiring the data used in study 2 and study 3. Also, special thanks to Gavin L. Simpson, who after helping me with several issues posted on <stackoverflow.com> and Twitter, agreed to co-write the paper resulting from Study 2.
