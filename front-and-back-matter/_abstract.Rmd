**Background**

Administration of intravenous fluids is a frequent medical intervention during surgery. However, fluids have side effects, and increasing concern is being raised about the widespread use of intravenous fluids. To reduce side effects, fluids should only be administered to patients who can mobilise the added fluid via an increase in the heart’s stroke volume (SV)---this is called a fluid response. If a patient’s SV does not respond to fluid, they do not benefit from the fluid and can only experience side effects. 

Several methods for predicting a patient's response to fluid have been proposed. One of the best indicators that a patient’s SV will increase with fluid administration, is high ventilator-induced pulse pressure variation (PPV): the cyclic change in pulse pressure caused by mechanical ventilation. However, after this method was developed patients are generally being ventilated with lower tidal volumes ($V_T$) and higher respiratory rates (RR), and it has been shown that this *lung-protective* ventilation lowers the predictive accuracy of PPV.  

Another approach to fluid responsiveness prediction is the mini-fluid challenge (MFC), where a patient’s fluid-responsiveness status is tested with a small amount of fluid. Only if the patient responds to the MFC, should a larger bolus of fluid be given. The hypothesis that the  MFC-response predicts the response to a larger fluid bolus has been investigated in several studies.

**Aims**

The aim with this PhD project was to tackle challenges in fluid responsiveness prediction during surgery. Specifically, I wanted to develop methods for overcoming current clinical limitations to the use of PPV, and to understand and describe a methodological problem present in most MFC studies.

**Papers**

This dissertation is composed of three papers:

Paper 1 describes how the design used in most MFC studies creates a mathematical coupling between the predictor (the MFC-response) and the outcome to predict (the full fluid response). This causes an overestimation of the MFC’s predictive ability. An improved design is suggested.

Paper 2 introduces generalized additive models (GAMs) as a tool for analysing medical time series and waveforms. We demonstrate that GAMs can be used to calculate PPV in situations where the classical method fails, and that GAMs can decompose a central venous pressure waveform into physiologically meaningful components.

Paper 3 presents a clinical study of the effects of $V_T$ and RR on PPV. The results indicate that using a GAM-derived PPV may help overcome some current limitations to the use of PPV, and that PPV’s predictive ability might be improved by adjusting PPV for $V_T$.
